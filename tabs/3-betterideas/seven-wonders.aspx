Wanted to see them not just as they are, but as they were in their full majesty glory.						<br /><br />						Unfortunately seeing them today, even ravaged by time as they are, has never been easy. Many are located far off the beaten tourist track in locations that are both difficult and expensive to access. The very idea of being able to visit more than one or two of the seven within the boundaries of a single vacation has been virtually unthinkable for all but a handful of the world's wealthiest and most adventurous people.						<br /><br />						Until now, until Eurasia. In Eurasia guests will be able to view all Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, meticulously reconstructed to replicate the originals to the full extent that archeological knowledge permits.						<br /><br />						Touring the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, viewing the collections of original artifacts on loan from museums and universities near their original locations, is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience available only at Eurasia.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
