It will also be a magnificent profit center, with guaranteed naming rights revenues of $1 billion over the 20 years of the NeuroMama contract.						<br /><br />						Speaking of NeuroMama.com, there was a time not so long ago... less than 15 years ago actually - when Yahoo was everything Google is now. The "unassailable" sultan of search, the master of the Internet, the king of the web surfing mountain.						<br /><br />						And it was true. Yahoo was "invincible." Invincible in exactly the same way in which the Titanic was "unsinkable." Invincible until it ran into an iceberg called Google. An iceberg that sent Yahoo to the bottom and steamed on without ever looking back.						<br /><br />						So today there sits Google firmly upon the throne once occupied by Yahoo. Invincible. Nicknamed "Gooliath" by search-engine optimization insiders.						<br /><br />						But NeuroMama also has a nickname. It's called "David." And it will topple Gooliath as swiftly and easily as Gooliath dethroned Yahoo.						<br /><br />						And in so doing it will be telling its billions of users that Las Vegas, the new "Wonder of the World" Las Vegas that Eurasia is helping to build, is once again the most alluring, exciting place on earth for anyone - high-roller, low-roller, or even no-roller - to visit.						<br /><br />						You can find much more about NeuroMama.com in Part 2, Chapter 1: Casting the Marketing Net.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
