By establishing a presence here these countries are doing more -- far more -- than simply helping Eurasia become a true international community. They are also playing a major role in fostering cooperation and understanding among nations and peoples from all corners of the globe.						<br /><br />						Since each national attraction will be largely staffed by citizens of its represented country - highly skilled specialists like fine professional chefs, exchange students working in their country's restaurants and bistros and shops for experience and college credits, docents guiding visitors through museums and exhibit halls displaying their country's artifacts and treasures - sport and skill contests between these groups are bound to attract massive interest from participants, spectators and the media. What kind of international games? What events that will highlight the way in which all the inhabitants of the world are different but still related?						<br /><br />						How about some events centered on cuisine? After all, every culture has one. Cuisine events. Tastings as they're called in much of the world. Or just plain cook-offs as they're usually nicknamed in America. American clam chowder versus Russian borscht? A classic French boudin blanc vs. a merquez from one of France's most prominent 19th and 20th century colonies, Morocco? Pizza from Bastiglia versus pizza from Brooklyn? And, lest we forget, Nathan's hot dogs versus the entire panoply of Germanic wursts. And then there are the issues of style and craftsmanship. So many places in the world claim to produce the best porcelain, the best hand-carved icons, the most tightly woven quilts and blankets.						<br /><br />						Regular skills competitions featuring native handcrafts will not only provide unique ways to educate and entertain casual visitors to Eurasia and to help drive traffic to Eurasia's malls, they will also significantly help keep the tradition of handcrafting alive by seeing that it becomes known and appreciated by the teen and young adult native peoples working at Eurasia.						<br /><br />						Speaking of the teens and young adults from all those countries, chances are many of them will appreciate the chance to engage in some sporting competitions with their global neighbors. Some universal games, baseball and basketball come to mind, lend themselves seamlessly to heads-up "my country's team against yours" games.						<br /><br />						Others would work equally well pitting teams comprised of players from different countries against each other. Games like beach volleyball, for example, where a team made up of girls from many countries could play a similarly configured team of boys.						<br /><br />						A Southern California coed in a bikini playing volleyball on the same team with a mufti-shrouded Saudi? Look out ESPN, we're gonna kill you the day that game runs on our sports network.						<br /><br />						Other planned competitions include dance contests, native instrument concerts and an annual beauty pageant to crown a "king" and "queen" to become Eurasia's youth ambassadors to the world.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
