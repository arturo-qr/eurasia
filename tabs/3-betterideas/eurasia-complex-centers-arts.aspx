Likewise, off-Broadway as a place where non-experimental theater was the exception not the rule, has recently become a "cesspool" of small theaters competing for tourist dollars by staging low-budget, ramped down revivals of faded fantasies from its own glory days - plays like the Fantastics, which were already old and wheezing their way to the bone yard by the time they ended their original runs decades ago.						<br/><br />						Securely subsidized by Eurasia, the Global Performing Arts Theater will be a beacon for the world's best and brightest live theater "not-ready-for-prime-time" players. Unknown writers, unknown directors, unknown actresses, unknown actors... all young, beautiful and full of fire and passion for their craft, all fighting for their slice of the Global Performing Arts Theatre limelight, their chance to shine, their chance to break through.						<br/><br />						One very interesting thing about the Global Performance Arts Theater-- it may be the only place on earth visitors will ever be able to "discover" the next Arthur Miller during a script read through at 10 in the morning and experience the Prague Opera Company's spellbinding performance of Verdi's Rigoletto at 10 that evening.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
