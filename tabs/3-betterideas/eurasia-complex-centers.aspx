They take place in technologically backward big box "convention halls" operated by old-line casinos or multipurpose hotel meeting rooms built as cheaply as possible to fill otherwise non-productive floor space.						<br/><br />						Named after the commercial and business center of ancient Egypt for more than 400 years, the Tanis Convention Complex at Eurasia, will feature an almost infinitely configurable 2.7 million square foot exhibit hall synergistically linked to state-of-the-art, purpose-built conference centers, hospitality suites, business centers and meeting rooms located in each of Eurasia's 45 resort casinos. Tanis will offer a superior convention experience and environment in a multitude of ways large and small. Here are just a few:						<br/><br />						-- The Exhibit Hall: Ultra configurable to make it as productive for organizers of 50,000 square foot mini-shows as it is to those of 2.5 million square foot mega conventions, the Tanis Exhibit Hall can be re-partitioned and laid out to simultaneously host ten or more shows of varying sizes.						<br/><br />						With full electrical service available at each display without prior arrangement or installation-by-electrician costs, towering 40-foot ceilings, a major loading dock in the back plus one loading ramp on each side, the Hall will offer the fastest load-in, set-up, tear-down and load-out times in Las Vegas.						<br/><br />						Other amenities in the Hall include onsite video production capability via Fantazmus Studios, a broad selection of wide angle or spot lighting from permanent light textures mounted above each vendor space, premium aisle carpeting and 24-hour licensed and bonded security patrols.						<br/><br />						An integral part of the full Eurasia complex and thus covered by Eurasia's master contract with Local 26 of the Culinary Worker's Union, the Tanis Exhibit Hall will be Las Vegas' only standalone convention venue able to serve world-class ethnic food and beverages in its refreshment kiosks and provide similar gourmet catering service to exhibitors.						<br/><br />						-- Purpose Built In-Resort Conference Facilities: What exactly is a "purpose-built" conference facility? It is, simply put, a set of meeting rooms, display areas and auditoriums drawn on the same blueprints as the main structure they're located in.						<br/><br />						-- Purpose-built Small Conference Centers? Configurable spaces designed from the ground up to host seminars, sales meetings, workshops, awards presentations, banquets and, yes, even shareholders meetings.						<br/><br />						At Eurasia, each of our 45 internationally themed casino resorts and six non-casino suites-only resorts for corporate clients interested only in convention business and private negotiations, will contain its own purpose-built conference center. A "let's do some business" aggregation of high-ceiling, designer lit meeting rooms equipped with real wood conference tables with built in outlet strips for laptops, tablets, and other electronic productivity tools, ergonomically correct desk chairs, and a raised dais for speakers and presenters.						<br/><br />						-- Advanced Technology: Unlike most hotel and resort conference centers, the Eurasia Resort's meeting and public rooms are designed as much for doing as they are for talking.						<br/><br />						Hydraulically activated risers built-in to the floors of the larger rooms make it easy to convert a flat-seating space into a raisedseat, curved auditorium perfect for staging demonstrations.						<br/><br />						Seventy-seven-inch, interactive multimedia whiteboards, a dedicated rear platform for video projectors and computers take making presentations to a new level. And 100MB fiber-optic	Internet pipelines empower the level of high-definition audiovideo streaming needed to focus in on subjects like surgeons performing experimental procedures in an operating room three continents away.						<br/><br />						-- Flexibility: Eurasiaâ€™s meeting rooms are designed to be redesigned. To be converted overnight from a typical insurance company policy-writing workshop room to a technology of tomorrow demonstration classroom with an advanced security monitoring system, audio-enhancement technology and onebutton, remote-controlled lesson videotaping capability.						<br/><br />						-- Private access to our casino-free resort hotels from the Convention Center and adjacent malls and entertainment area.						<br/><br />						-- The Golf Courses: No resort ever lost a convention bid by bragging about its golf course. Tanis Convention Center guests will be the only conventioneers in Las Vegas with access to not one, not two, but three onsite 18-hole, PGA-championship quality courses, each bearing the individual footprints of the championship golfer who godfathered its design.						<br/><br />						Tanis conventioneers will, In fact, be the only convention goers in Las Vegas to have onsite access to any golf course at all.						<br/><br />						-- Professionally Staffed Business Centers: No question, the days of wandering down to a hotel computer cubicle to check email and flight schedules are long gone. Everyone travels with a laptop, tablet and/or smartphone these days.						<br/><br />						But not everyone travels with a high-speed four-color copying machine or a real fax machine that can handle bound volume pages or oversized printed documents in addition to computer generated electronic docs. It's equally true that many hotel front desk employees are not as sharp about handling ultra time-sensitive FedEx shipments as they should be. Or about letting you know immediately when your 12 cartons of late-arriving brochures show up.						<br/><br />						Which is why every Eurasia Resort will contain a true business center started by professional personal assistants. Personal assistants who can do everything from notifying you when that endlessly re-dialing fax finally gets through to helping you score an extra couple of hundred business cards in less than an hour.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
