Hundreds of millions of men, women and children participate in them and at least a billion enjoy them as spectators.						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery">							<li><img src="/images2/p2_chapter_12_1.jpg" alt="Center" width="250px"></li>						</ul>						As an internationally themed resort complex, Eurasia will contain first class playing fields and auxiliary facilities for the world's most popular sport, soccer, also called football in many countries; America's most popular spectator sport, football to Americans and American football to the rest of the world; American's National Pastime, baseball; the globe's leading sport in number of millionaire participants, polo; and the world's number one participant sport, swimming.						<br /><br />						All five of these gold-standard sports complexes will serve two functions. They will be venues where professional and amateur contests will be staged for spectators enjoying a degree of comfort unknown to all but luxury box holders at typical stadiums and they will serve as part of Eurasia commitment to community service by providing regional schools, recreational leagues, and youth development agencies with well-equipped, perfectly landscaped facilities for team training camps, practices and games.						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery2">							<li><img src="/images2/p2_chapter_12_2.jpg" alt="Center" width="250px"></li>						</ul>						Fully lighted to professional standards by Eurasia's environmentally friendly, renewable energy generation systems, Eurasia's playing fields will set a new standard in green sports facilities by enabling team competitions to stay out of the glaring desert sun while remaining in full view of onsite and broadcast audiences without any appreciable drain on the planet's energy reserves.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="/images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="/images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
