The primary vehicle for delivering this multi-million dollar blitz of ads, promotional spots, product placements and Internet search return hits is a Joint Marketing Strategy to leverage the power of our N e u r o m a m a .com search engine, and our television broadcast and cable distribution agreements and the industry's most robust, expert viral marketing campaign.						<br/><br />						For example, 2,800,000 commercials for Eurasia and its malls will be broadcast on television, cable and satellite networks North and South America, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia, for 36 months beginning 90 days prior to the Malls opening. Valued at more than one billion U.S. dollars, this advertising campaign will air in native languages in South America, Russia and other major markets.						<br/><br />						Frankly, N e u r o m a m a .com, which will carry links and/and or display ads for Eurasia and its malls on billions of return pages a day, will do to Google exactly what Google did to Yahoo approximately one decade ago... knock it off its perch on the top of the search engine mountain. And it will do it for two reasons, the speed, quality and relevance of its neural technologyderived search returns and the power of its Frequent Searcher Rewards (FSR) program.						<br/><br />						The fact is computer systems and programs designed with neural technology are simply better than legacy computer systems and applications because they learn while they earn. Regular computer programs, such as Google's circa 20th Century search engine, are only as smart as the people who designed them.						<br/><br />						Computer programs designed with neural technology, however, are based on extraordinarily complex mathematical algorithms that enable them to learn from the humans who are using them. Which is what separates today's sophisticated neural programming systems from earlier, crude attempts to deploy programs based on artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence, simply put, is just a form of machine intelligence, it can only "learn" (mimic actually) from its own internal successes and failures. Neural intelligence, as the name implies, empowers a computer to learn from its daily interactions with human users. How much more advanced are neural technology-based systems? Look at it this way, when IBM was producing chess-playing computers that regularly lost to human grand masters they were using artificial intelligence. Now they are using neural programing and their chess computers routinely beat the same grand masters.						<br/><br />						Here's an example. Let's say 1,000,000 people averaging 30 years old use our search engine. By learning from these 1,000,000 people, our search engine will quickly acquire wisdom... 30,000,000 years of wisdom. By the time N e u r o m a m a .com attracts 100,000,000 users, which should take about six months, it will have acquired three billion years of knowledge, experience and wisdom. Google, Bing, Yahoo and the other search engines will be literally billions of year's worth of education behind.						<br/><br />						The second, even more compelling reason people are going to abandon Google and become addicted to N e u r o m a m a .com is less intellectual and more emotional. It's called greed. Also known as FSR, also known as NeuroMama's Frequent Searcher Rewards program, the very first cyberspace implementation of the airline industry's tried and true Frequent Flier Awards marketing initiative.						<br/><br />						With N e u r o m a m a .com's FSR program, end users automatically receive points for every search they make and every email they send or receive using NeuroMama's ultra-secure, bulletproof, web mail service and bonus points for every new user they send NeuroMama's way. As with Frequent Flier "miles," Frequent Searcher points will be redeemable for all kinds of things... upscale electronics, online game play, software and media downloads, etc. But the most heavily promoted, greatest value (number of points needed to value of award ration) FSR prize will be free travel and resort accommodations... specifically free travel to Eurasia and accommodations at one of its mall-adjacent resorts.						<br/><br />						And when we say travel to Eurasia will be the most heavily promoted of all the numerous Frequent Searcher awards, we're putting the emphasis on "heavily." FSR is NerouMama.com's signature user acquisition tool, no other search engine has anything like it and it's going to be promoted continuously and pervasively. Promoted not just on N e u r o m a m a .com itself, but also on Google and the other major search engines via the purchase of millions of AdWord and other clickthrough ads. Clickthroughs to landing pages that prominently extol the Eurasia Malls as a primary reason to make Eurasia the site visitor's destination vacation resort of choice.						<br/><br />						The above deployments are just of the Eurasia marketing blitz, the traditional part. There's also the new media part, the viral marketing part. Viral marketing the fastest, best and most effective way to promote anything on the Internet. Viral marketing, the Information Age's version of history's most effective, successful form of advertising... word of mouth.						<br/><br />						Create a clever marketing message that will get some hits on a social network site like YouTube and from there people see it and put the link on their Facebook page, or in a blog, or they Tweet about it and suddenly -- suddenly as in a week or less - it spreads like a virus and your message is being seen by 700, 800, 900 million new people a day.						<br/><br />						Sounds easy, but it's actually incredibly hard because you're not just competing for attention with a relative handful of new promos airing on TV every month, you're competing with hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of new messages posted to popular online sites daily.						<br/><br />						Which is why we brought Tom Brennan on board to manage Eurasia's viral marketing campaign. Widely known as the Godfather of Viral Marketing, Tom is the founder and CEO of two groundbreaking viral marketing agencies and the author of the Viral Video Handbook, the best-selling bible of the industry.						<br/><br />						Our first series of viral videos will be 90-second slice-of-life episodes of visitors enjoying themselves at Eurasia, half of these will be devoted to the overall resort and half to the malls.						<br/><br />						Creative and comedic enough to generate mass buzz and hardcore enough to sell people on spending their vacation and other disposable income at Eurasia, they're guaranteed to go viral and garner millions of viewers. After all, where else on YouTube can you find a video of a sexy man in Armani and a sultry woman in Jimmy Choo make-love-to-me shoes scoping out diamond earrings under the watchful eyes of two sharks and a barracuda.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="/images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="/images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
