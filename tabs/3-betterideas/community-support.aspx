For example, we intend to have educational and training facilities not only for our staff, but also for coaches and promoters in the Sports Pavilion. There will be educational facilities in the Technology Pavilion, within the international areas and in Fantazmus Studios.						<br /><br />						<span class="style2">							-- The Palace of the Little Angels						</span>						<br /><br />						In addition, there is one project especially dear to our hearts -- the Palace of Little Angels -which will benefit the children of Las Vegas, Clark County and surrounding areas.						<br /><br />						Little Angels is an after-school and weekend learning and event center for children. We plan on creating a new education standard by providing an enriched cultural environment, using the resources available throughout the complex. Children will have access to advanced level extracurricular programs in fine and performing arts, and instruction in music lessons and history, with an emphasis on learning to play an instrument, ballet, drama, literature and science. There will be a Performing Arts Palace Theater, a finishing school, state-of-the-art multimedia laboratories, indoor gymnasiums and sports training facilities, and outdoor playing fields for both casual and organized sport competitions. Athletic programs will include gymnastics, golf, tennis, equestrian skills and archery. The Palace will be administered by experienced professionals with requisite management skills, including individuals with hands-on managerial experience with a similar program.						<br /><br />						As our prime education initiative, we will establish and fund a Foundation to build and manage the Palace of the Little Angels. This foundation, under a board of directors composed of internationally known educators and local teachers and parents, will set a new educational/recreational standard, enhancing the lives and spurring the intellectual and physical development of tomorrow's leaders and other responsible citizens.						<br /><br />						The Palace will be designed to emulate aspects of Michelangelo's late Roman buildings, particularly St. Peter's Basilica. It will be protected by a hybrid security system featuring state-of-the-art electronic intrusion and warning systems and highly paid security professionals well trained to eliminate both external threats and internal corruptive influences such as drug and alcohol use.						<br /><br />						<span class="style2">							-- Wind Farms and other green initiatives						</span>						<br /><br />						--EURASIA will contract development of Wind Farms to be used as a source of renewable electric power for most of EURASIA's energy needs. All buildings and attractions will be developed and implemented as green buildings. We consider the environment and water conservation to be of the utmost importance, as we aim to be leaders in the environmental causes as well.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
