By inviting the public to become intimately involved in the creation of entertainment productions -- many of them featuring well-known American and international cinema and TV stars -- as members of the audience, back stage spectators or even walk-on bit players, the Studios will draw tens of millions of visitors to Eurasia and its retail partners.						<br/><br />						Thanks to its strategic partnership with Pacifica Ventures, a major entertainment industry production enabler with state-of-the studios in Albuquerque Pennsylvania, and Connecticut studios, Fantazmus will have immediate access to and credibility with every major studio and independent film producer.						<br/><br />						For the record, Pacifica's recent credits include the cutting-edge, 100% green-screen production of The Spirit, Terminator: Salvation, the Denzel Washington thriller The Book of Eli, Marvel Studio's The Avengers, Disney's The Lone Ranger and four seasons of the Emmy-winning AMC drama series Breaking Bad. It is currently hosting the SONY/Columbia Production 1000 AE.						<br/><br />						Here are just a few of Fantazmus initial original productions:						<br/><br />						<ul class="gallery2">							<li><img src="images2/p2_chapter_1_6.jpg" alt="Fantazmus Studios" width="200px"></li>						</ul>						<span class="style3">							-- International Festival of Live Entertainment						</span>						<br/><br />						Featuring entertainers from around the world competing against other competitors in the same category. the International Festival of Live Entertainment will consist of 12 monthly challenges to select category winners and one "Live Entertainer of the Year Shootout" to crown an overall Entertainer of the Year.						<br/><br />						Categories include 1. "Best Cirque Cabaret," 2. "The Best Air Flying Act," 3. "Best Clown," 4. "Best Magic Act," 5."Best Acrobatic Act," 6. "Best Contortionist Act," 7. "Best Vocalist," 8. "Best Choreographed Act," 9. "Best Juggling Act," 10. "Best Unusual Act," 11. "Best Childrens Act," 12. "Best Circus Animal Act"						<br/><br />						Each of the competitions will be broadcast live via satellite up-link directly from the Studios in the Las Vegas Dream Mall and recorded, translated into native languages and rebroadcast worldwide via Internet streaming and cable networks throughout the following week.						<br/><br />						<span class="style3">							-- Las Vegas Best Kept Secrets Revealed by the Casino Waitresses of Las Vegas						</span>						<br/><br />						One hundred percent scripted by writers who spent hundreds of hours interviewing real Las Vegas waitresses, Las Vegas Best Kept Secrets Revealed by the Casino Waitresses of Las Vegas will star professional actresses and be highlighted by guest spots from big name entertainers appearing in other Fantazmus Productions or live onstage in one of Eurasia's showrooms.						<br/><br />						An unprecedented peek at the real Las Vegas as told by some of the people who know it best, the series will offer thousands of product promotion spots for the Eurasia Mall's retail tenant.						<br/><br />						<span class="style3">							-- The Rich, The Famous and The Lucky						</span>						<br/><br />						With Eurasia's resorts, casinos, malls, golf course, and entertainment centers serving as both the backdrop and, in some ways, the actual star of the program, The Rich, The Famous and The Lucky is a soap opera about the curious, the hopeful and the obsessed from every strata of national and international society.						<br/><br />						<ul class="gallery">							<li><img src="images2/p2_chapter_1_7.jpg" alt="Fantazmus Studios" width="200px"></li>						</ul>						Answering the siren songs of softly spinning roulette wheels, clattering slot machines, whirring automatic card shufflers, neon signs, exotic trysts, and stacks of chips, they are drawn to the Casino weighed down by the kind baggage bellmen never see.						<br/><br />						Baggage. Hopes. Dreams. Bitter aftereffects of shattered affairs and devastated businesses. A longing for reinvention of themselves, their lives, their memories. A wish that they could "do it all over again" and a hope that maybe, somehow, the casino might allow them, at least for the moment, do just that.						<br/><br />						Standing in the center of this hive of money, people and lust is the Casino boss, his wife, the daughter he may or may not have fathered' and a host of other intriguing, mystery-shrouded characters who are universally more than they seem. The key character in "The Rich, The Famous and the Lucky," the Boss is a shadowy billionaire hero around whom everything revolves.						<br/><br />						Everyone knows some things about the Boss, but no one, not even his family and closest associates know everything. Immigrating to the United States from Russia as a penniless young man, he started running errands for Wall Street players, learned the secrets of the Street as fast as anyone ever had, and began making small investment deals that always seemed to pay off big.						<br/><br />						<ul class="gallery">							<li><img src="images2/p2_chapter_1_8.jpg" alt="Fantazmus Studios" width="250px"></li>						</ul>						Eventually he began initiating bigger deals, bringing companies together in alliances that skyrocketed the share prices of both. From there he started taking private global companies public and acquiring companies outright.						<br/><br />						Legend has it that his status as a financier was so impeccable that he bought the Casino and its sister casinos in Atlantic City and Hong Kong with a cashless transaction.						<br/><br />						Exactly how did he go from being a small-time day trader to a billionaire speculator and entrepreneur? Who are those hard-looking men who show up, generally in a cab direct from the international terminal at McCarran, spend half a day conferring with the Boss and quietly cab back to the airport? Which of his lieutenants are loyal and which are trying to stab him in the back.						<br/><br />						And just who, exactly, is the eerily knowing young woman who shows up to work as an entry level trainee one day and winds up virtually running the resort after the top manager's disappearance? You, and the thousands of people who will flood the Malls weekly in between standing in line to watch the tapings -- will just have to wait until the last episode to find out.						<br/><br />						<span class="style3">							-- Live From Eurasia in Las Vegas On Saturday (or maybe Sunday) Night						</span>						<br/><br />						A shameless clone of Saturday Night Live? Of course. In television, imitation is more than the sheerest form of flattery, it is also the surest way of guaranteeing a show will be a hit. If it weren't, the whole world wouldn't be watching Crime Scene Investigators ply their trade in every city from Miami to Merced.						<br/><br />						Written, staged and directed by such former Saturday Night Live luminaries as Joe Belushi, Tim Kazurinsky and Tony Rosato, our SNL clone will leverage the "this could only happen on live TV" spontaneity and comedy of the original SNL and the unique glitz and glamour of Las Vegas to build something strikingly unique on the platform of SNL's familiar format.						<br/><br />						<span class="style3">							-- Waves of the Future						</span>						<br/><br />						<ul class="gallery2">							<li><img src="images2/p2_chapter_1_9.jpg" alt="Fantazmus Studios" width="250px"></li>						</ul>						Fantzamus Studios in Eurasia's Las Vegas Dream Mall will also serve as an incubator for the next generation of entertainment superstar directors, producers, writers and performers by providing stateof- the-art production and editing facilities to help them make real the dreams upon which much of the remaining 21st Century's most vibrant entertainment will be based.						<br/><br />						Using our advanced taping, staging, video and audio effects and post-production tools, they will be able to drive their micro-budget TV, film and musical projects from inception to perfection in one place, in one continuous timeframe. Once their projects are completed to perfection, we will help them send them out into the world via Global's owned and operated steaming media service and contracts with international cable and over-the-air broadcasters.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="/images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
