A better place for our children and grandchildren and their children to grow up in, to thrive in.., a world where they can truly become all that they can be and all that we would hope them to be. To do this, we intend to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for charitable purposes. Let me give you some examples of our priorities.						<br /><br />						In the environmental area, we will be supporting and financing efforts to shut down a proposed nuclear plant near Lake Baikal, the deepest, purest lake in the world. This nuclear plant, if not stopped, has the potential to make Chernobyl seem like a backyard bonfire if and when disaster strikes. We also intend to do our part to bring the reality of global warming and the melting icecaps home to people. Do you know that 80% of the ice cover on Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, a glacier that has existed for 11,700 years, has disappeared in the last hundred years. Even more frightening, the annual loss -- which was 1% between 1912 and 1953 -- has escalated to 2.5% in more recent times. At that rate, Mount Kilimanjaro will be totally ice free in as little as 10 years.						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery2">							<li><img src="images2/p2_chapter_20.jpg" alt="Center" width="280px"></li>						</ul>						Just imagine what kind of havoc that rate of change will have on the millions of acres beneath that mountain. In Russia, along with our efforts to shut down the nuclear plant near Lake Baikal, we will also work to stop the ongoing destruction of the Siberian forests... forests which currently contain 25% of the world's trees and generate 25% of the planet's oxygen.						<br /><br />						Understand this, we are not just going to be talking about these evils, we are going to be very proactive in fighting them. Particularly in the legal area, where we will file will file lawsuits in the countries affected and in the international courts. We will sue everyone involved in these ecological rapes... companies, directors, politicians, whoever is allied with the guilty parties.						<br /><br />						Closer to home we will file suits to stop drug dealers from poisoning our children and grandchildren. We will le against attorneys and judges who help drug dealers stay out of prison altogether or get away with very short prison sentences. We will sue politicians personally and in their official capacity if they refuse to vote to increase prison sentences.						<br /><br />						Also in the United States, we will take legal and political action to curtail the Gestapo activities of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In just the last five years, the INS with the full cooperation of the United States attorney and the federal court system, has broken up about 2,000,000... 2,000,000... families by deporting immigrants who for one reason or another ran slightly afoul of a legal system they did not yet know and understand.						<br /><br />						What we're talking about here is minor offenders, mothers and fathers who did not kill anyone, rape anyone or molest any children, who don't sell any drugs to children or adults... Who did nothing to cause the state to throw them out, leaving behind a single-parent child or, or worse a child fated to be raised by other relatives or in foster homes. We're also talking about thousands and thousands of non-offenders. Families who came to this country to work, to contribute, invited to come here and work by the American citizens who employed them and promised to take care of them. Thousands and thousands of non-offenders, of honest families who did nothing wrong whatsoever, deported simply because it became a politically expedient thing for unethical politicians seeking the cheapest possible votes to support throwing them to the wolves.						<br /><br />						Thousands and thousands of people deported while the bosses who employed them, who brought them here, who promised to take care of them and get them green cards, remain totally unpunished, charged with nothing, subject to not even a punishment as meaningless as a $50 fine. Again we will sue in their personal and official capacities congressmen who refused to vote to change these deportation laws. To stop the INS from bragging every year, as they have since 2002, that they have once again recorded a number of deportations.						<br /><br />						On the cultural front, Amnistya will support artists, musicians, sculptors, architects... anyone who devotes their talents to the creation of classical works of music or other art that embody themes of timeless beauty, cultural tradition and convey a sense of trust and security. We will also provide worldwide support for the sport of rhythmic gymnastics, which is the fastest growing Olympic sport for young girls. A sport giving them unique opportunities for artistic expression. if you're not sure what this spectacular, exquisite sport is all about just go to YouTube and search for rhythmic gymnastics.											<br /><br />						One more very important thing, Amnistya, in addition to its own charitable activities, will enable both existing charitable organizations and individual compassionate people to more easily engage in fundraising for good causes. It will provide protection to donors by screening individuals and groups claiming to be legitimate charities. It'll provide back office functions such as collections, record keeping, filings, providing tax recent receipts to claim deductions, etc. to nonprofit organizations. That's just a few of the almost 30 services Amnistya will be providing to the good people, the generous people, of the world.						<br /><br />						Leveraging our sister companies, such as TVIMama.com and Aces of Acts, in broadcasting, streaming media distribution and live entertainment, Amnistya will also provide communication channels - TV spots, billboards, radio messages, etc. -- for the major institutional and individual charitable donors serving on the Foundation's board to reach out to individual contributors. Also, volunteer activists and fund-raising event contributors will be eligible for discounts and free admissions at Eurasia's resorts in Las Vegas and other U.S. and international cities and free merchandise from Eurasia/NeuroMama.com marketing partners. 						<br /><br />						So that's where the Amnistya Childrens Foundation sits, firmly on the side of the angels. Just like you are. The question now is simple, what is the best way for us to go forward today to help upcoming generations get to where they must be tomorrow.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
