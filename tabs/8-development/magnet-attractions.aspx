Ready for the next generation of robot combat? Live events where eight-foot-tall state-of-the-art humanoid robots will rock 'em and sock 'em in a boxing cage until one is defeated. Robot Combat League and the project have been kept under wraps. The action resembles a real-life version of last year's hit movie Real Steel, with large menacing robots pounding away at each other in a satisfying shower of sparks and gushing hydraulic fluid. And just like in the film, the 'bots will be controlled by shadow-boxing operators whose movements are translated into metal-on-metal punches. WWE wrestler, author and Dancing With the Stars veteran Chris Jericho will host. Robot Combat League will delivers what's promised - robots pounding on each other. Robotics systems has been created that can mimic a human's actions and movements. You'll see robots decapitated, you'll see robots cut in half. It will be truly spectacular... and... you'll be able to make real bets...							</li>							</br>							<li>								The largest in the world 800-foot-high Ferris wheel - the world's tallest attraction, which will also be the world's largest advertisement for soft drink.								</br></br>								WE WANT TO CREATE UNIQUE SHOPPING AND ENTERTAINMENT...
