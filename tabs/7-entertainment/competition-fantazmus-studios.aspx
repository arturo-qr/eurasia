Frankly, we consider this a perfect opportunity for us to give something back to the entertainment community in the same way that it's a perfect opportunity for contestants to chase their dreams.						<br /><br />						A perfect opportunity, as well, for TV viewers around the world to get a peek behind backstage and see how people with no professional training and background can - and occasionally do - break through into sunlight and stardom.						<br /><br />						Finding people anxious to put it all on the line in front of the cameras won't be limited to checking out the wannabe performers who show up for the studio's daily auditions. Thanks to FameZilla, our mobile studio-on-wheels,  our talent spotters will be proactively staging screen and vocal tests throughout all Fantazmus' public areas - the theme part, the malls, the exhibit areas, the beaches and hangouts every part of the property except, of course, the casinos, sports books, professional sports venues, golf course and lodging areas.						<br /><br />						In simplest form, two host/talent spotters, three musicians and two technicians will travel the grounds in FameZilla, a wildly customized mini-tour bus outfitted with state-of-the-art remote multimedia production equipment. Seeing a likely looking group of people, FameZilla will stop and a pneumatically powered mini-performance stage will slide in place from the underside of its chassis. At this point one of the talent spotters/performers will pop up on the roof through a concealed hatch, pick up a bullhorn and shout "Who wants to be a star?"						<br /><br />						(Note: We chose to use a bullhorn because it adds a nice, retro county fair ambiance to the process that will play well with TV audiences everywhere.)						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery1">							<li><img src="images2/competition_fantazmus1.jpg" alt="Competitions" width="480px"></li>						</ul>						Once the hosts pick a group of likely contestants from the hundreds of people ringing Famezilla, those selected will be invited to give spontaneous, impromptu talent demonstrations. Our musicians, selected for their encyclopedic knowledge of songs, will provide accompaniment to singers and dancers, the hosts will give hopeful actors and actresses audition script scenes to read, and amateur comics will be invited to "take five minutes to make everyone laugh."						<br /><br />						At the end of each tryout, spectators will vote and the winning contestants will be invited down to the Studio to appear in a studio production. Meanwhile, Famezillabe rolling toward its next destination and technicians back at the studious will begin editing the video microwaved from Famezilla into an upcoming installment of the Eurasia Famezilla Reality Show.						<br /><br />						Fantazmus Studios will also offer exciting and entertaining competition similar to that seen by tens of millions of people weekly on the runaway hit program "Project Runway." Only our contestants will be challenged to create film rather than fashion.						<br /><br />						As on Project Runway, a panel of entertainment pros will review "reels" submitted by talented amateurs from around the world and chose 12 or 13 to become contestants on the weekly series. Each week the contestants will be challenged to create a five-minute video of a specific type - a commercial for a food product, a historical or geographical documentary, a romantic encounter, classroom instruction, etc. 						<br /><br />						Each competitor will be provided with housing at Eurasia, an HD camcorder and accessories and a digital editing booth located within the Fantazmus Studios complex. Contestants will be taped in the process of creating their videos and their completed projects will be screened, critiqued and rated by an all-star panel of Hollywood directors, writers and cinematographers. The judging will be taped live in front of a studio audience each week with one contestant sent home after every round until only one man or woman is left standing.						<br /><br />						The winner will receive a full suite of professional cinema tools donated by various companies on a product promotion basis, travel expenses and entry fees to show their completed projects at major short film festivals, and the opportunity to direct and film a series of promotional and commercial spots for Global's worldwide cable and satellite networks.						<ul class="gallery1">							<li><img src="images2/competition_fantazmus2.jpg" alt="Competitions" width="480px"></li>						</ul>					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
