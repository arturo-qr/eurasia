Likewise, off-Broadway as a place where non-experimental theater was the exception not the rule, has, in recent years, become a cesspool of small theaters competing for tourist dollars by staging low-budget, ramped down revivals of faded fantasies from its own glory days - plays like the Fantastics, which were already old and wheezing their way to the boneyard by the time they ended their original runs decades ago.						<br /><br />						Securely subsidized by Eurasia, the Global Performing Arts Theater will be a beacon for the world's best and brightest live theater "not-ready-for-prime-time" players. Unknown writers, unknown directors, unknown actresses, unknown actors â€¦ all young, beautiful and full of fire and passion for their craft, all fighting - fairly or sometimes not-so-fairly -- for their slice of the Global Performing Arts Theatre limelight, their chance to shine, their chance to break through.						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery">							<li><img src="images2/competition_arts.jpg" alt="Competitions" width="270px"></li>						</ul>						One very interesting thing about the Global Performance Arts Theater, it may be the only place on earth visitors will ever be able to "discover" the next Arthur Miller during a script read through at ten in the morning and experience the Prague Opera Company's spellbinding performance of Verdi's Rigoletto at ten the same evening.											</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
