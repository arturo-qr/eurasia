America. The United States. The good old US of A. The land of the free and the home of the brave.						<br /><br />						Whatever the label you use doesn't matter. Has never mattered. Will never matter. Because all those names mean the same thing. They mean the same thing in English and they mean the same thing in any language you care to translate them into.						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery1">							<li><img src="images2/competitions1.jpg" alt="Competitions" width="480px"></li>						</ul>						What they mean, what they translate to is this: The greatest country on earth. The greatest country the world has ever seen.						<br /><br />						America.						<br /><br />						The highest Gross Domestic Production (GDP) in the world. So high, in fact, that the U.S. GDP accounts for a total of 34 percent of the entire planet's GDP. Thirty-four percent of the world's global production... that's what the United States generates despite having less than 5 percent of the world's population.						<br /><br />						America.						<br /><br />						The highest per capita income of any major country on earth. The highest per capita rate of car ownership, home ownership and real estate ownership of any major country on earth. The highest per capita rate of individual business owners and corporate shareholders any major country on earth.						<br /><br />						America						<br /><br />						The place that former President Ronald Reagan defined as being "too great for small dreams."						<br /><br />						What made, and continues to make, America the greatest country on earth? The country where only big dreams are good enough to come true?						<br /><br />						What made America great, can't be anything as simple as the Almighty choosing to honor songwriter Irving Berlin's request that "God bless America" That explanation is clearly impossible because America had already been the greatest country on earth for generations by the time Berlin wrote his song.						<br /><br />						No there's another reason America became great, a reason that everyone from psychologists to industrialists to politicians to union leaders can agree on. America became the greatest country on earth because it was the first nation ever to be founded on the principle of competition. On the principle that life is a series of challenges to be met and overcome.						<br /><br />						America.						<br /><br />						No hereditary rulers here. No kings, queens, dukes, earls, czars, emperors or, heaven forbid, crown princes. No. Never. Not here.  If you want to rule America or any state, city or hamlet in America, you have to compete for it. Compete for it and win and continue periodically competing for it and winning for as long as you want to continue ruling.						<br /><br />						American history is marked by fierce and sometimes bloody competitions. The War Between the States, the war between the sheep herders and cattle bosses, the farms and the factories, capital and labor, the forces of prohibition and the demands of those who enjoy a sociable drink or two, the pitched battles between the railroad barons fighting for access to the best passes and lowest grades with which to surmount the Rockies. 						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery2">							<li><img src="images2/competitions2.jpg" alt="competitions" width="250px"></li>						</ul>						Those are just a few of the major national competitions that shaped America. Competitions that regardless of who won and who lost ended with America being a healthier, stronger, greater country than it was before.						<br /><br />						America, a country so competitive that it refers to the ultra serious business of financing the entire capitalistic system on which the country's economic existence rests as “playing.” As in playing the stock market. As in playing cards. Only in America, does the public consider the funding of its largest commercial entities, companies with hundreds of billions of dollars in sales and hundreds of thousand employees, a game. And, you know, something, that also is one of the things that makes us great.						<br /><br />						There are also the uncounted millions of daily competitions that mark America.  Want a better job? You almost always have to compete for it. Got your eye on a new lover? Chances are you'll have to compete for him or her as well. Want to increase your company's market share? You'll definitely have to compete for that. 						<br /><br />						Want to change people's minds about war, peace, the price of gasoline, zoning ordinances, the best college, the sexiest hair style, gun control... anything and everything? You can do it, you can change minds, but it won't be easy. The marketplace of ideas is perhaps the most competitive arena in all America.						<br /><br />						Competition. Yes, competition is the lifeblood of America. It is what makes America great. Because we thrive on it, because we're good at it, because we enjoy it and couldn't, in fact, bear to try and live without it.						<br /><br />						The American heritage of challenges and rivalries is one major reason why Eurasia's every feature, aspect, and activity will contain contests and competitions galore. Sports competitions, talent competitions, intellectual and scientific competitions, educational competitions.  Major global competitions like Formula One Grand Prix races, international competitions between native peoples from the 108 nations represented in Eurasia and public competitions for the men, women and children who visit. 						<br /><br />						Competitions of every kind that will delight and, in some cases amaze, spectators and participants. Competitions of every kind that will also provide the content for thousands of hours of unique, exclusive programs on our numerous cable, online and streaming media TV networks.						<br /><br />						Yes, the glory of America, a glory born of the competitive urge that lives in so many of its 300 million-plus citizens is one reason we are embedding numerous competitive events throughout Eurasia. 						<br /><br />						But there is another reason. And that one is called Las Vegas.						<br /><br />						Las Vegas. 						<br /><br />						Las Vegas, the most competitive city in the world's most competitive country. A city founded by the railroads during the most highly competitive era of the Industrial Revolution, a city that totally ignored a statewide ban (1910-1931) on games of chance, a ban so strict it made coin flipping a criminal offense.						<br /><br />						Las Vegas as we know it today was created by people competing against the house, competing against other players, competing against the desert sun back in the un-air conditioned 30's when a gun-toting Benny Binion opened his first Fremont Street gambling parlor in partnership with J.K. Houssels.						<br /><br />						Las Vegas, the only place on earth where you can bet on things like the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show or where a falling comet is going to strike the earth. Las Vegas, its history and culture. That's the other reason Eurasia is going to be one very, very highly competitive place.						<br /><br />						Describing all of Eurasia's hundreds of competitive activities, contests and amateur and professional sporting events would require a book all to itself. Here, organized by venue, are just some of the highlights.						<ul class="gallery1">							<li><img src="images2/competitions3.jpg" alt="Competitions" width="480px"></li>						</ul>					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
