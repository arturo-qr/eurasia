The REAL CIRCUS only available today in the EURASIA?						<br /><br />						Not the FAD of Circus Du Soleil, which is on its deathbed will soon die. After which we will hire their best performers. Except for one, their biggest star Vlad Myagkostupov. As the son our company's president, Vlad works for the Cirque du Soleil through a special arrangement with Aces of Acts and will be joining us immediately ... just as soon we reach agreement with the Trop. 						<br /><br />						Do you see it right there on Las Vegas Boulevard Cirque performers doing a five minute show every 20 minutes. And nearby an incredible scary crocodile and a monkey playing on an old stringed musical instrument.						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery1">							<li><img src="images2/fantazmus_circus.jpg" alt="CIRCUS" width="480px"></li>						</ul>						And over there a hand-organ and another monkey running around 100's of people watching this show and begging for charity as he gives out discount coupons for the show and maybe a $5 chip that can only be used on EURASIA gaming tables or $1 or $2 some kind of financial instrument that can only be used on EURASIA slot machines. That alone will make 1000's of tourists walking by want to go into EURASIA to play...						<br /><br />						Do you see some of them are running into EURASIA because the show is about to begin?						<br /><br />						Or do you see another option to draw the people from the boulevard, another option which we will make available to you...? This one is kind of similar to a ski lift, but instead of the seats for skiers, it has platforms hanging on trusses..... and on every platform is a little cirque act.... and on some of them are clowns..... moving back into the casino.... and people are following these platforms.... so they don't miss any of these free shows..... and eventually they step on the moving walkway... the moving walkway taking 1000's of people into EURASIA every day.....on either side of the moving walkway are funhouse carnival mirrors..... and they are laughing and pointing their fingers at each other's funny reflections ... they are happy, jovial, ready to play, ready to gamble.						<br /><br />						Do you see the spectacular Cirque Breakfast, and Lunch Shows with trained monkeys, dogs and cats? And families with kids lining up to get in? Happy kids in the EURASIA's video gaming rooms while their parents first use up their free $5 tokens on the gaming tables or slots..... and then start changing one hundred dollar bill after another?						<br /><br />						Do you see unforgettable Cirque Dinner and Complete Cirque Production Show with impressive and smart elephants and the cutest Russian bears doing all kind of things that most people can't do? And the EURASIA children's playrooms with all the classic and modern toys, something kids will remember for the rest of their lives.						<br /><br />						Do you see stunning Complete Classic Cirque Show with first-rate Symphony Orchestra from Russia playing Mozart, Bach, Rossini, Brahms, Amilcare Ponclielli, , and separate Cirque Dinner Show.... also with orchestra.... and on both of them the breathtaking horse act  with horses running and cavaliers jumping from the ground on top of this horses and that, back and forth making the most incredible acrobatic acts... and the orchestra playing extremely fast Aram Chachaturians "Sabre Dance" and "Lerzghinka", and Rimsky-Korsakov's "The Flight of the Bumblebee"?						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery2">							<li><img src="images2/fantazmus_circus2.jpg" alt="CIRCUS" width="250px"></li>						</ul>						Do you see all the and different people coming to see this shows.... they are all wearing the most expensive clothes..... a lot of them are pulling up in expensive cars and limousines..... a lot of them are high-rollers... this is the old Vegas coming back..... but this time around EURASIA is the center stage for High Society... everyone from "who is who" keep coming back...						<br /><br />						And now do you see glamorous Cirque Style Cabaret... where the first act is a show in Greco-Roman style with tigers, leopards and panthers and fire, and dancers dressed and looking and moving like wild animals, climbing the rope and the nets .....and then these beautiful dancers turn into wild animals..... real tigers and leopards, and panthers...... and then these wild animals claiming the ropes and nets..... and then everything comes down with exquisite rhythmic gymnasts effectuating the best cabaret type show ever, a show that even the real "Le Crazy Horse de Paris" can't match? 						<br /><br />						Now try to imagine the same glamorous Cirque Style Cabaret..... but this time add Symphonic Orchestra and additional exquisite ballet acts? This is the Late Night Cabaret show...... and features these same animals..... but there is something different..... it's the spectators... the crowd has changed..... this crowd has arrived on all sorts of private jets at McCarran's Executive Terminal..... Challengers, Dassault Falcons, Gulfstreams, Learjets.... 						<br /><br />						It is an hour long wait to release the aristocracy. There is Donald Trump steaming in his Boeing 727-23, Roman Abramovich and his Boeing 767-33A, The Sultan of Brunei has arrived on his Boeing 747-430, Mark Cuban on his Boeing 767-277, Bill Gates and his Bombardier BD-700 EURASIA Express is there, Wayne Huizenga on his de Havilland Canada DHC-6-320 Twin Otter, Harrison Ford and his Cessna 525B CJ3 Citation Jet..... I don't think you'll see anytime soon an Air Force One... it would be politically incorrect to abuse the privilege of the Oval Office.						<ul class="gallery1">							<li><img src="images2/fantazmus_circus1.jpg" alt="CIRCUS" width="480px"></li>						</ul>					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
