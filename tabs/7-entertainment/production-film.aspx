This soap opera will be broadcasted on cable and satellite networks in US and abroad.						<br /><br />						This will be a modern day morality tale about an owner of Las Vegas casino and the billionaire Michael Blackbeard who came to the United States penniless. Michael main business is the trading on inside information and to take over the world largest companies. This casino is the place for him to hang his hat, where he deals with his personal and professional issues in his home and business life.  						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery2">							<li><img src="images2/production_film.jpg" alt="CIRCUS" width="250px"></li>						</ul>						Set inside a major casino resort drawing the curious, the hopeful and the obsessed from every strata of national and international society, "The Rich, The Famous and the Lucky" is about a kind of brick-and-mortar Pied Piper. People  â€“ if only in their imagination -- hear the softly spinning roulette wheel, the loud clatter of the slot machines, the crisp whir of the automatic blackjack card shuffler as it quickly combines eight decks into one.						<br /><br />						They hear these sounds while visions of neon signs and exotic lovers and stacks of chips dance before them in the theater of their minds. Heeding these siren calls, they are drawn to the Casino weighed down by the kind baggage bellmen never see.						<br /><br />						Baggage. Hopes. Dreams. Bitter aftereffects of shattered affairs and devastated businesses. A longing for reinvention of themselves, their lives, their memories. A wish that they could "do it all over again" and a hope that maybe, somehow, the casino might allow them, at least for the moment, do just that.						<br /><br />						Standing in the center of this hive of money, people and lust is the Casino boss, the key character in "The Rich, The Famous and the Lucky," the shadowy billionaire hero around whom everything revolves.						<br /><br />						Everyone knows things about him. How he came to the United States from Russia as a penniless young man, started running errands for Wall Street players, learned the secrets of the Street as fast as anyone ever had, and began making small investment deals that always seemed to pay off big.						<br /><br />						Eventually he began initiating bigger deals, bringing companies together in alliances that skyrocketed the share prices of both. From there he started taking private international companies public and acquiring companies outright.						<br /><br />						Legend has it that his status as a financier was so impeccable that he bought the Casino and its sister casinos in Atlantic City and Hong Kong with a cashless transaction. 						<br /><br />						Everyone knows these things about the Boss only because those are the things he wants them to know. The other things, the ones that make him a mystery man, are known to none. Trying to find out how many companies he owns and which countries he operates in is an exercise in futility. 						<br /><br />						And exactly how did he go from being a small-time day trader to a billionaire speculator and entrepreneur? And who are those hard-looking men who show up, generally in a cab direct from the international terminal at McCarran, spend half a day conferring with the Boss and quietly cab back to the airport?  						<br /><br />						Will these questions be answered by the 13th and final episode of "The Rich, The Famous and the Lucky's" first season? Maybe, yes. Maybe, no.						<br /><br />						In keeping with the programs theme of a highly skilled, motivated, entrepreneur surviving and prospering in the corporate jungle by playing only his own rules, EURASIA is employing a revolutionary new business model to maximize the distribution, revenue, and ROI of its programming.						<br /><br />						To the best of my knowledge we are the only company planning to finance this Soap Opera and the  feature film virtually 100 percent with money from product placements.						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery1">							<li><img src="images2/production_film2.jpg" alt="CIRCUS" width="480px"></li>						</ul>						For example, on the 'The Rich, The Famous and the Lucky" we're looking for EURASIA Hotel/Casino to provide for promotional payments that will cover 50 percent of the actual production cost of the series. The other 50 percent, plus the physical costs of putting the program into EURASIA distribution, will come from smaller product participations by car, fashion, beverage, travel, cosmetic, electronics, cell phone and other companies, as well as from various sources described in the next paragraph.  						<br /><br />						Using this financing approach means that almost all distribution revenue generated by the program will go on the profit side of the ledger. Instead of using first-run earnings to pay down the production cost, which is the traditional way to finance TV shows, our first-run revenue will be, to a large extent, pure, unencumbered gross profit.						<br /><br />						We will agree to pay back the casino an amount equal to their investment in this project, before we draw any profit.						<br /><br />						This is an exceptional deal for the casino. EURASIA will get their money back, plus advertising that will last centuries					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
