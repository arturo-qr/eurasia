								Being a Casino Resort Vacation DestinationHot Spot is No Longer Enough, Shopping, Like Size & Shows, Really Matters
							</span>
						<!-- <p class="pass1"> -->
								<br/><br />
								There are casino resort destinations all over the world from Macawto Marrakech, lots of them.
								<br/><br />
								What is far less common are destination shopping resorts. Retail complexes so extraordinary in their size and scope, in their variety of exclusive fashion, jewelry, furniture and other unique merchandise from all the countries of the world, in their alternate reality ambiance and entertainment spectaculars,that people will travel from all over the world to shop and spend two, three, for or more nights there.
								<br/><br />
								The Eurasia Project brings Las Vega the most compelling, must go and see and shop experience in the world.
								<br/><br />
								Twenty-three times the size of Forum Shops, seven times as big as the Fashion Show Mall,with more than the double the leasable space of the New South China Mall, currently the world’s largest mall, Eurasia’s two historically themed retail complexes – the Alexandra Mall and the Las Vegas Dream Mall will total more than 15,000,000 square and include the world’s first underwater “shop-through” aquarium, and scores of ethnic restaurants conceived and staffed by native people’s broughtto Las Vegas to work in the 101 Eurasia hotels,pavilions and casinos dedicated to the architecture and culture of a specific Euro-Asian nation.
								<br/><br />
								Other people magnets integrated into the shopping malls will be themed museums with ancient Egyptian and other artifacts loaned to Alexandra by top-rank government museums and galleries from around the world, numerous state of the arttheaters featuring everything from world premiers of the latest mosttechnologically advanced giant screen 3D fully immersive features to performances of the history’s mostrevered symphonies,ballets and operas by top touring companies.
								<br/><br />
								The <strong>Alexandra Mall</strong> and the <strong>Las Vegas Dream Mall</strong> will also feature continuous live entertainment of far greater scope than has ever before been presented in any retail shopping complex. From the danger and speed of chariot racing to the beauty and grace of the newestOlympic sport, rhythmic gymnastics, Eurasia’s malls will have something for everyone. Especially, globe and nation-hopping shoppers interested in the best, most exclusive, products from the top designers and manufacturers. 
								<br/><br />
								The trendiest fashions from top Paris, Turin and NewYork designers, a truly formidable array of diamonds and other precious gems – raw stones direct from the mines of African and priceless antiquities in timeless mounts from empires long gone, shoes straight off the pages of Vogue, Elle and the other trend setting magazines, private-label hand-rolled cigars unavailable anywhere else in America,watches thatreveal the wearer’s substantial networth as well as the time, and every major upscale department and specialty store in the world.
								<br/><br />
								They’ll all be there. The Retail Royalty of the world will all be here. Be here because itwould be politically and strategically incorrect notto be here … high-rolling customers quickly notice when a top boutique is conspicuous by its absence. 
								<br/><br />
								They’ll be here because of the millions of dollars of media exposure they’ll get from news of Alexandra and Las Vegas Dream events and shows and the even more millions of dollars in free advertising theywill get from onscreen appearances in the background of numerous TV shows and features produced onsite at Eurasia’s Fantazmus Studios.
								<br/><br />
								They’ll be here because of the billions of Internet end user impressions they’ll receive through their strategic relationship with our search-engine subsidiary, NeuroMama.com,the world’s only neural-technology powered search engine and the only search engine with a true end user loyalty program.
								<br/><br />
								They’ll be here because our mall space will be designed, developed, leased and managed by a syndicate of some of the mostrespected and trusted firms in the commercial real estate industry, companies like Simon PropertyGroup and Prudential.
								<br/><br />
								Most of all,retailers will be fighting to lease space in Eurasia’s retail complexes because the combination of reasonable square foot rates (roughly half that of the Forum Shops) and massive traffic (an estimated 75 million annually to Forum Shops approximately 25 million annually) is,to use a cliché often associated with the early days of the Strip, a deal they can't simply can’t afford to refuse.
