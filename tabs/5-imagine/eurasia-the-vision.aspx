It's because they look at it through the wrong set of eyes.						<br /><br />						You need more than 20-20 eyesight to recognize a good investment, you need 20-20 vision ... and vision is not the same thing as eyesight.						The blind man ... "sees" through his fingertips, through his nose.... through an enhanced ability to hear and locate sounds...						The blind man.... sees through a heightened awareness of space and place and the environment around him.						<br /><br />						Some people might call the way the blind man sees a kind of extrasensory perception, but, you know, what he is really doing is using a different set of "eyes" than you and I use.						What the blind man is doing ... is using his mind's eye ... He is taking all this input from his physical and mental senses, and in his brain he is assembling it into a picture that is projected on what some people call the mind's eye and others call the mirror in the mind.						<br /><br />						Either way, call it anything, what he is doing is seeing with a different set of eyes.						Do you see all the and different people coming to see this shows.... they are all wearing the most expensive clothes..... a lot of them are pulling up in expensive cars and limousines..... a lot of them are high-rollers... this is the old Vegas coming back..... but this time around EURASIA is the center stage for High Society... everyone from "who is who" keep coming back...... 						<br /><br />						And now do you see glamorous Cirque Style Cabaret... where the first act is a show in Greco-Roman style with tigers, leopards and panthers and fire, and dancers dressed and looking and moving like wild animals, climbing the rope and the nets .....and then these beautiful dancers turn into wild animals..... real tigers and leopards, and panthers...... and then these wild animals claiming the ropes and nets..... and then everything comes down with exquisite rhythmic gymnasts effectuating the best cabaret type show ever, a show that even the real "Le Crazy Horse de Paris" can't match? 						<br /><br />						Now try to IMAGINE the same glamorous Cirque Style Cabaret..... but this time add Symphonic Orchestra and additional exquisite ballet acts? This is the Late Night Cabaret show...... and features these same animals..... but there is something different..... it's the spectators ... the crowd has changed..... this crowd has arrived on all sorts of private jets at McCarran's Executive Terminal..... Challengers, Dassault Falcons, Gulfstreams, Learjets.... 						<br /><br />						IMAGINE.... that this clear Plexiglas..... also some of the walls making up the underground shopping center itself and restaurants and shops. What does it looks like..... you got it..... Atlantis that went under water.....						<br /><br />						The Las Vegas Dream Mall rides attraction will bring millions of people, as well as reinforcing the concept..... Theme park for rides with rides between aquariums...... For people really to take advantage and to see all the aquariums.... they will have to take rides.... therefore we don't need a lot of rides..... also they will be riding through Cirque acts......						<br /><br />						Yes.... there is already an Atlantis in Forums.... and in Bahamas.... However nothing of this magnitude has ever been built anywhere .... no hotel, casino or resort on earth - has an attraction like this - a "must see" attraction ... an attraction that will become a destination in and of  itself, that will draw visitors who come to Las Vegas just to see this one thing and then to decide to stay awhile and spend their money.						<br /><br />						IMAGINE.... that in the middle of an open space are chariot races, chariot races with Neptune's instead of gladiators. Imagine all waitresses are dressed as mermaids. 						<br /><br />						Now... now... IMAGINE the whole picture, the big picture ....all of this combined with Cirque Style Productions simultaneously going on everywhere..... but nothing like Circus-Circus..... 						<br /><br />						Something spectacular.... a few big shows per day ... Chariot races. gladiator fights with tigers and lions...... and nets, nets, nets with beauties climbing up and performing there...... and a lot of Arial acts, where flying artistry displays a spectacular stage presence, accomplished physical strength and poetry, theatrics and excitement..... the Aerial Silks Group where four aerialists perform synchronized combination drops from top to bottom, Duo Aerial Silk Combination of Ballet with cirque arts, Aerial Ring Act, Aerial Straps Act... Aerial Ring Act ... Aerial Dreams..... 						<br /><br />						NOW ... IMAGINE ... that we will use our POWER and this strategic resource of CLASSIC ARCHITECTUAL ORNAMENTATION - THE ELEMENTS OF PALACE BUILDINGS ...  to build the most beautifully designed EURASIA HOTEL CASINO RESORT in Las Vegas ... and later in other countries.						<br /><br />						IMAGINE ... that we know how to save money on construction, by prefabricating elements of palace building, marble and granite, as well as replicating art work in Mexico.						<br /><br />						IMAGINE ... that the Airport, Formula 1 Race Track, Sports Arena, The world's Largest Shopping Mall and many other elements of EURASIA will be designed and built by Tilke Engineering and J.T. Kruer and Co.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
