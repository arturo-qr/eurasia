This block of TV advertising time is Valued at more than One Billion U.S. Dollars and this 2,800,000 commercial spots can also be exchanged for advertising on other channels and networks.						<br /><br />						This TV advertising Campaign is the result of the Joint Marketing Strategy between Latin American PLANEX X TV, EURASIA and NeuroMama.com and will be the world largest TV advertising Campaign.						<br /><br />						The Joint Marketing Strategy of EURASIA, NeuroMama.com and PLANET X - an Extreme Sports TV Network operating throughout Latin America the promotional ramp up to the launch event will begin in May 15 with major advertising and program placements on Planet X. In addition to PLANET X TV the advertising will start on soon to be launched two new Latin American TV networks, CONTRA - a boxing and other martial arts theme TV Network, and a PREEMINENCE TV - the network highlighting the lifestyle of affluent, Rich and Famous, as well as lifestyles of young corporate executives.						<br /><br />						Another three networks in Russian Language are planned to be launched in former USSR countries and other parts of the world for Russian language spectators. The three networks are PLANET X - Russia, KONTRA - - in partnership with WCK the boxing and other martial arts theme TV Network possibly with Vitally Klichko the heavy weight champion of the world as the host, and THE RICH AND FAMOUS - the network highlighting the lifestyle of affluent, Rich and Famous, as well as lifestyles of young corporate executives.						<br /><br />						Global will launch NeuroMama.com (http://NeuroMama.org/) on a Billion Dollar (CDN)						Content Distribution Network owned and operated by our European partners. Their technologically advanced CDN has been designed, developed, implemented and is currently delivering more than 1,000,000 films and other TV programs over the Internet to more than 50 million subscribers around the world in seconds.						<br /><br />						Our search engine will be better than Google, because it is based on Neural Technology. What does it mean?						<br /><br />						Regular computer programs are only as smart as the team of people, who have designed them. Computer programs, which have been used to operate Google and all other search engines, are regular computer programs.						<br /><br />						Computer systems designed with Neural Technology, are based on very complex mathematical algorithms and are programmed to learn from people who are using these systems. To implement Neural Technology solutions, first a person must be a scientist mathematician, who knows computer programming. Not a computer programmer, who knows some mathematics.						<br /><br />						How much more advanced Neural Technology based computer systems versus regular systems? For example, if you take only 1,000,000 people with an average age of 30 years, who will be using our search engine. By learning from these 1,000,000 people our search engine will acquire wisdom of 30,000,000 years. Today is 2013.						<br /><br />						What if 100,000,000 people will be using our search engine? Our search engine will acquire 3 billion years of knowledge, experience and wisdom. How many people could have been working on research, design, development and implementation of Google? 100? 200? 500?						<br /><br />						Now do you understand the advantages of implementing Neural Technology in the Search Engine's computer based system?						<br /><br />						It is common knowledge that former USSR and now Russian mathematicians are exceptionally well educated, and this is why Russian professors of mathematics are teaching today in most of the world's prestigious universities, as well as in many other universities.						<br /><br />						Let me add right here ... to save you from having to ask ... this partner is a private company owned by Russian billionaires and I am contractually forbidden to identify it to anyone who hasn't signed an ND-NC agreement.						<br /><br />						I can tell you, however, that this partner, this company that is implementing our search engine is the world's oldest, largest and most technologically advanced provider of entertainment and informational programming over the internet.						<br /><br />						It has been in business for two decades, has 30 times more programs in its instant library than Netflix and has 2.5 times Netflix's number of subscribers, with each subscriber paying an average of more than $20 a month than typical Netflix subscribers pay.						<br /><br />						So, their track record is a very important factor in making Global's NeuroMama a very low risk investment.						<br /><br />						However, by going to our streaming system http://tvimama.com/ ... you'll see the most technologically advanced Video-ON-Demand system, which has been developed and implemented by our partners as a sample for investors. (usid: demo, pswd: demo)						<br /><br />						What's going to draw them in the first place?						<br /><br />						Number one, we're going to spend a lot of money on marketing. Among other things, we're going to buy the phrase "Better Search Engine" and "World Largest Shopping Mall and the Casino Resort" on Google AdWords. And since no one is bidding on those phrases, we can get it really cheap, under a penny per click.						<br /><br />						So when people go to Google.com, more times than not.... they'll see our ad at the top in the right column because there really isn't much competition ... nobody is buying AdWords for search engines.						<br /><br />						So they will see that once, twice, three times when they go to Google and ... you know something, human psychology being what it is, about the fourth or fifth time they'll be curious enough to click on it and they will go to NeuroMama.com and EURASIALASVEGAS.COM, eurasiacasinolasvegas.com, eurasiamacau.com, eurasiacasinomacau.com, eurasiasingapour.com, eurasiasingapore.com, eurasiacasinosingapour.com, eurasiacasinosingapore.com, eurasiaspain.com, eurasiacasinospain.com, eurasiaarmenia.com, eurasiacasinoarmenia.com, eurasiamorocco.com, eurasiacasinomorocco.com, eurasiaatlanticcity.com, eurasiacasinoatlanticcity.com, eurasiavietnam.com, eurasiacasinovietnam.com, eurasiajapan.com, eurasiacasinojapan.com, eurasiacasino.com, eurasiavirtualcasino.com, eurasiaonlinecasino.com, eurasiainternetcasino.com						<br /><br />						<strong>							AND... learn about our rewards programs and our neural-intelligence enhanced search technology and they'll try it.						</strong>						<br /><br />						We will do the same with Facebook. The only thing with Facebook we have hands on experience and much more control than with Google. We'll connect NeuroMama.com to Facebook. The same way we had connected a half a dozen of our video games.						Connecting our video games to a Facebook platform, has given all Facebook users an instant access to our video games the same way they have access to ZYNGA games.						<br /><br />						This time around we'll buy from Facebook ads, which will say "Better Search Engine." To make sure that we don't pay more than a penny per click, these ads will be displayed only to Facebook users, who had used "Google Search" or "Googled" at one time or another.						<br /><br />						We're also going to buy the phrase "Better Search Engine" and "World Largest Shopping Mall and the Casino Resort" on Facebook AdWords. And since no one is bidding on that phrase, we can get it also really cheap...						<br /><br />						People are going to really love and become addicted to our FSR and FGR program. FSRFGR ...Frequent Searcher Rewards and Frequent Gambler Rewards. It's just like an airline frequent flyer program only better.						<br /><br />						With FSR-FGR, users get points every time they enter a search or send or receive an email using NeuroMama's ultra- secure, bulletproof, web mail service. They even get free bonus points if, for some reason, the service doesn't perform up to expectations. If, for example, a search takes a half second or so too long to complete.						<br /><br />						With FSR-FGR, users get points every time their referrals, and the referrals of their referrals enter a search or send or receive an email using NeuroMama's web mail service, and get free bonus points when the search takes a half second or so too long to complete.						<br /><br />						This is the solution for Multi-Level Marketing for NeuroMama.com and its users, who will be earning free points for everyone whom they had introduced to NeuroMama.com.						<br /><br />						With points redeemable for free travel, upscale electronics, online education, game play, software ... all kinds of products and services ... people will never be tempted to use another search engine. Tens, hundreds of millions of them, will make NeuroMama their default search engine, their SEARCH ENGINE OF CHOICE.						<br /><br />						What will happen then? Advertisers all over the world: Fortune 500 advertisers, mom & pop ecommerce advertisers. Advertisers WILL MAKE NEUROMAMA.com THEIR MARKETING SEARCH ENGINE OF CHOICE FOR THEIR MONEY.						<br /><br />						<strong>They'll try it and once they try it, THEY'LL BE OURS. They'll see that PGS delivers everything we promise and more and THEY WILL BE OURS FOREVER. And they will go on Facebook and Twitter and tell all their friends about this great new search engine they found.						</strong>						<br /><br />						Number two ... is the media. We're going to get more free media coverage than any Hotel Casino because The World Largest Shopping Mall beyond the obvious universal.						<br /><br />						We're going to get more free media coverage than any new software tool beyond the obvious universal.... ones like Windows 8, or a new Microsoft Office Suite, or a complete Facebook redesign ... but, beyond that.... We will get the most massive coverage of any new product in this century.						<br /><br />						Because (a) ... No one has ever applied neural programming to search engine technology. So that guarantees NeuroMama.com coverage by all the technology and webmaster and computer geek media outlets.						<br /><br />						And (b) ... No one has ever launched a search engine before by offering a loyalty program, free premiums or any incentives whatsoever ... that guarantees us coverage by all the sales and marketing media outlets.						<br /><br />						And (c) ... No one has introduced a search engine --- especially a revolutionary, game changing search engine like NeuroMama  -and gotten it ready to go public in almost a decade. Ten years. That alone will make our launch big news in all the financial news outlets.						<br /><br />						And there's an intangible factor that's even more important ... we, as a company are simply better at manipulating the media than other companies. We have better news release writers, we have marketing communications executives with better contact lists, the girls making "vendor visitors" to demonstrate NeuroMama.com to editors, reporters and financial analysts will be younger, prettier, smarter and sexier than women doing the same job for other companies.						<br /><br />						And this is just the tip of the NeuroMama marketing iceberg ... the traditional marketing. That doesn't even include new media, viral marketing, and the fastest, best and most effective way to promote anything on the internet.						<br /><br />						Let me ask you a question. What has been the most successful form of advertising?						<br /><br />						You guessed it. Word of mouth advertising... it's never been beat, not by TV, not by anything...						<br /><br />						Viral marketing is the word of mouth advertising of the Internet Age. You create a clever marketing message that will get some hits on a site like YouTube and from there ...people see it and put the link on their Facebook page, or in a blog, or they Tweet about it and suddenly -suddenly as in a week or less- it spreads like a virus and your message is being seen by 700, 800, 900 million new people a day.						<br /><br />						So for our first series of viral videos we're going to do comic 90-second slices of life stories of people enjoying the premiums they got from using PGS as their search engine. But they're going to be using them in weird and funny ways...						<br /><br />						And to make sure our viral videos do get seen by hundreds of millions of people as soon as we release them we've brought Tom Brennan as a part of our management team, the Godfather of Viral Marketing, to manage the VM campaign for NeuroMama and EURASIA.						<br /><br />						Let me tell you a little something about Tom, in addition to being the founder and CEO of two ground-breaking viral marketing agencies, Tom wrote the Bible on the viral video marketing ... the Viral Video Handbook, the best-selling book ever written on the subject by a factor of more than three-to-one.						<br /><br />						Aces of Acts, is Global's Strategic Guerilla Marketing Resource. <a href="http://acesofacts.com/">http://acesofacts.com/</a>						<br /><br />						Aces of Acts is the Cirque Style Production Company and Talent Management Agency, run by one of the most authoritative, accomplished and skilled people in Cirque world - Anatoliy Myagkostupov, who is along with his son Vladik are members of Global's management team.						<br /><br />						Aces of Acts is the Las Vegas & Nationwide Award Winning Cirque Style Productions Company specializes in offering exceptionally unique Cirque theatrical presentations for exclusive special events, marketing events, and corporate entertainment.						<br /><br />						What separates Aces Of Acts from any other entertainment company is Aces Of Acts team who has the top education, and countless years of experience in entertainment industry.						<br /><br />						Aces specialty is to incorporate Acts and Shows into corporate and marketing events to create a spectacular and memorable experience.
