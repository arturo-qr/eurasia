The game shows Dealer's Choice & Las Vegas Gambit and the first half of the first season of the revival of the game show Let's Make a Deal was taped here.						<br /><br />						No one has introduced permanent TV studios in casino --- especially live TV show, game-changing TV show like "International Festival of Live Entertainment from EURASIA in Las Vegas" -in a quarter of a century. In Twenty Five Years.						<br /><br />						It's been twenty five years since Merv Griffin bought Resorts International Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City and has filled the rooms and gaming tables with spectators of his TV shows, and later sold it to Sol Kerzner of Sun International Hotels for $350 million. That alone will make our launch big news in all the financial news outlets.						<br /><br />						And there's an intangible factor that's even more important ... we, as a company are simply better at manipulating the media than other companies. We have better news release writers, we have marketing communications executives with better contact lists, the girls making "vendor visitors" to our products to editors, reporters and financial analysts will be younger, prettier, smarter and sexier than women doing the same job for other companies.						<br /><br />						As part of a reward marketing program EURASIA LIVE ENTERTAINMENT CENTERS and NEUROMAMA.COM the new Artificial Intelligence based Search Engine, soon to be implemented by one of the world largest company, hundreds of thousands of people, can be rewarded with the stay in EURASIA every year.						<br /><br />						And this is just the tip of the EURASIA LIVE ENTERTAINMENT CENTERS marketing iceberg... the traditional marketing.						<br /><br />						That doesn't even include new media, viral marketing, and the fastest, best and most effective way to promote anything on the internet.						<br /><br />						Let me ask you a question. What has been the most successful form of advertising?						<br /><br />						You guessed it. Word of mouth advertising... it's never been beat, not by TV, not by anything...						<br /><br />						Viral marketing is the word of mouth advertising of the Internet Age. You create a clever marketing message that will get some hits on a site like YouTube and from there... people see it and put the link on their Facebook page, or in a blog, or they Tweet about it and suddenly -suddenly as in a week or less-  it spreads like a virus and your message is being seen by 700, 800, 900 million new people a day.						<br /><br />						So for our first series of viral videos we're going to do comic 90-second slices of life stories of people enjoying the premiums they got from using FSR. But they're going to be using them in weird and funny ways...						<br /><br />						And to make sure our viral videos do get seen by hundreds of millions of people as soon as we release them we've brought Tom Brennan as a part of our management team, the Godfather of Viral Marketing, to manage the VM campaign for EURASIA LIVE ENTERTAINMENT CENTERS.						<br /><br />						Let me tell you a little something about Tom, in addition to being the founder and CEO of two ground-breaking viral marketing agencies, Tom wrote the Bible on the viral video marketing... the Viral Video Handbook, the best-selling book ever written on the subject by a factor of more than three-to-one.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
