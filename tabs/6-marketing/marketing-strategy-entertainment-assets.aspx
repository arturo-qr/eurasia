They shouldn't even be called assets, but there's no other word for them in the English language.						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery1">							<li><img src="images2/marketing_assets1.jpg" alt="Nascar World" width="480px"></li>						</ul>						Let's say you've got a store or a warehouse or an ecommerce site, the asset value of inventory is limited by what it can earn from a single sale.						<br /><br />						The same thing is true even with an airline where the inventory is empty seats that can be sold over and over and over. The value of those assets, those empty seats, is still limited by the law of diminishing returns. Their value decreases geometrically as the aircraft gets older, the amount of time it is available for service goes down and the cost of maintenance and inspections goes up.						<br /><br />						Entertainment Assets.  A real crown jewel, because its assets are so timeless, so hardened against inflation, deflation, boom, bust, bears, bulls ... everything short of World War III						<br /><br />						Entertainment Assets is the glue that holds the whole enterprise together, the engine pulling all the other cars in the train.						<br /><br />						<strong>Entertainment Assets</strong> is the safety net that guarantees that EURASIA will continue to achieve substantial and continual profits regardless of declines in one or more aspects of the gaming industry.						<br /><br />						Entertainment Assets is our Fort Knox. A portfolio, for lack of a better term where we keep the corporate treasure. The "gold and diamonds" whose value remains unaffected by changes in currency rates, inflation, deflation or any other economic trauma.						<br /><br />						Entertainment Assets, are the most gild-edged assets any Brick and Mortar or Information Age company can have.						<br /><br />						Assets which are better than cash because their value isn't decreased by inflation.						Assets that area also known as "intellectual property."						<br /><br />						These assets are better than precious metals, where the number of really major buyers is limited and prices can fluctuate tremendously based on individual country's economic policies. They are infinitely better assets than a blue-chip stock portfolio ... unless you don't remember that American Airlines, General Motors, Fannie Mae, Chrysler and so many other bankrupts were once considered blue chips.						<br /><br />						In a sense, these assets are better than patents because patents timeout and expire in 18 years whereas most of our intellectual property will be legally protected for up to 120 years.						<br /><br />						Most of these assets will be entertainment programming. Billions of dollars worth of entertainment programming, tens of thousands of featured films, hundreds of thousands of hours of broadcast and cable TV series, special events, sports, and education programs. Millions of hours of programs and an ever-expanding collection of exclusive online games designed by our own in-house gaming division.						<br /><br />						These assets can be divided into two categories, those which we own outright and those for which we hold exclusive distribution and exploitation rights for the countries and continents in which we do business.						<br /><br />						It doesn't matter which category a particular program is in, its value is the same... because the value is the amount of revenue the asset will generate over the many decades will we have exclusive rights to it.						<br /><br />						Entertainment assets are beautiful things. They have no moving parts, they never break down, they never need maintenance and repair. They have no physical footprint; they exist only as digital files on computer servers. The cost of warehousing ten billion dollars worth of entertainment programming is so negligible it won't even show up as a line item on a balance sheet.						<br /><br />						But maybe, just maybe the best thing about entertainment assets is that they are never, ever sold. They are never even rented in the sense that the customer gets to take it home and use it. Entertainment Assets can be rented to 2000, 10,000, a hundred thousand customers simultaneously.						<br /><br />						And the residual value, the income that each of those assets generates every time a customer accesses it remains the same day after day, week after week, year after year. There is only appreciation, never depreciation with these assets.						<br /><br />						At this point you may be thinking about EURASIA LIVE ENTERTAINMENT CENTERS and saying to yourself, "yes, no, maybe, on one hand, on the other hand, should I ... shouldn't I, is this really the opportunity I've been waiting to increase revenues in EURASIA?"						<br /><br />						Is this it? The one that's going to hit big time? After all the failures, after all the near misses, after all the deals that paid off, but only in chump change? Is EURASIA LIVE ENTERTAINMENT CENTERS really the company that's going to make EURASIA shareholders rich?						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery1">							<li><img src="images2/marketing_assets.jpg" alt="Nascar World" width="480px"></li>						</ul>						Yes, EURASIA is the winner ...that is going to create delightful returns for you. That is going to wash away all the memories of bad investments, and dreams that just faded away and died.						<br /><br />						We are certain that years later ... our initiative will be ... as history will say ...a stunning success, one of the most amazing feats in the history of Hotel Casinos using Live Entertainment to generate admirable returns for its long term investors... without having to spend a dime!!!						<br /><br />						We can see "through" market conditions, strengths of competition, weakness in the economy, and political uncertainties. We can see that EURASIA is your stepping stone to transforming your company into a major global playerin the retail industry.						<br /><br />						We can see what it would mean to you as the decision maker ...what it would mean for your spouse, your kids and grandkids. We can see what it would mean to you as an investor, who may have lost money on the few deals, or still waiting for an exit on the few others - and all this gives our management team the vision to see what we need to do to make it succeed.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
