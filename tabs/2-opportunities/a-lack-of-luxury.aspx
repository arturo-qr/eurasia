							A Lack of Luxury International Resorts.
						</span>
						<br/><br />
						Yes, it DOES sound ridiculous. How could anyone say that Las Vegas, of all places, is lacking in luxury international resorts? After all, people visiting Las Vegas can already hang out in the shadow of the Ei el Tower, sing about "making it anywhere" in old New York, relax and get a tan on the shores of Lake Belagio.
						<br/><br />
						And those are just a few of the so-called international resorts already available  to Las Vegas visitors. So-called because they're really little more than Hollywood soundstage imitations of international resorts. Exotic and dazzling foreign fronts grafted onto all too familiar All-American resort hotel recreation facilities, showrooms, restaurants and guest rooms.
						<br/><br />
						Four- and Five-Star All-American resort hotel recreation facilities, showrooms, restaurants and guest rooms to be sure, but the operative words are still All-American. If you're a discerning traveler seeking accommodations truly redolent of an elegant Irish manor house or a luxury Left Bank Hotel de Villegiature, you will not find them in Las Vegas today.
						<br/><br />
						That's the bad news. The good news is that you will find them tomorrow. In Las Vegas. At Eurasia.
						<br/><br />
						At Eurasia, our 45 internationally themed resorts - six of them without casinos to better accommodate families uninterested in gaming and to respect the traditions and beliefs of their sponsoring country's citizens - will be operated with guidance and cooperation from a specific Eurasian country.
						<br/><br />
						Authentic cuisine - from tasty tapas to multicourse gourmet meals - will be made from traditional recipes using spices, herbs and other key ingredients flown in from traditional overseas sources and will be available 24/7 for both individual guests, private parties and full-blown banquets.
						<br/><br />
						And, of course, native entertainers of all types will be performing throughout each resort to add to the romantic, exotic "another time, another place" atmosphere of the entire experience.
						<br/><br />
						The Eurasia Resorts... 45 ways to cross the border and enter an alternative reality. Forty-five ways to spend a night, a weekend or a week in an exotic foreign port. Forty-five ways to escape. All of them within 60 minutes of Los Angeles International Airport.
