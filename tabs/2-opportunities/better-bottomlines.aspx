								Better Bottomlines Through Happier, Healthier Visitors

							Spend a little time just about anywhere in Eurasia and you'll discover one thing! No matter the hour of the day, day of the week, or month of the year, no matter if the temperature is 113 degrees or 50 degrees, you'll be surrounded by the happiest, most relaxed, most ready to play and gamble and shop group of tourists and local residents anywhere in Las Vegas.
							<br/><br />
							One big reason for this seemingly odd phenomenon is the plethora of live entertainment that envelops our guests almost everywhere in the complex they go. This 24/7 availability of live entertainment, everything from death-defying and side-splitting cirque acts, to the casual music of 100 different countries, to stage plays, orchestra concerts and sports events transparantly helps our quests relax, de-stress, lower their blood pressure, increase the amount of oxygen reaching their brain and reduce tension in the heart, lungs and muscles.
							<br/><br />
							Enjoying live entertainment can even, according to many medical researchers, temporarily relieve pain by triggering the brain to release endorphins.
							<br/><br />
							Even better and, perhaps, more surprising, a recent research report published by the prestigious Mayo Clinic says that live entertainment of the sort that will envelope you from the stresses, strains and disappointments of daily life.
							<br/><br />
							According to the Mayo Clinic study, enjoyable live entertainment can improve your immune system by triggering chemical changes that cause the body to release neuropeptides that can counteract stress and improve the organism's ability to fight more serious illnesses over a sustained period of time.
							<br/><br />
							Mayo researchers also found that pleasurable entertainment, particularly entertainment that produces laughter, may substantially aid the body in breaking down the pain-spasm cycle common to a number of long-term muscle disorders
							<br/><br />
							Is entertainment, particularly laughter really - as is so often facetiously claimed - "the best medicine?".
							<br/><br />
							If so, and medical evidence seems to indicate it is at least a highly effective, if not necessarily the "best", therapy, Eurasia guests have come to the perfect place to take the cure.
							<br/><br />
							After all, we have a belly-laughing barn full of the greatest clowns on earth.
