							Las Vegas is No Longer The Gaming Location of Choice for Many of the World's Top Professional Gamblers and High Rolling Tourists.
						</span>
						<br/><br />
						UNLV's Center for Gaming Research tells the story. "From 2000-2011", the Center resorts, "total Las Vegas Strip revenues have increased by 21%; by comparison, Consumer Price Index rose 31% in those years, so the Strip's revenues, adjusted for inflation, actually haven't advanced in the past ten years."
						<br/><br />
						Think about that... the Strip's gaming revenues, adjusted for inflation, have not increased... have not increased in ten years. Not increased in ten years. And that's not some publicist for Atlantic City or Macau talking. That's the University of Nevada Las Vegas speaking... and they're on our side.
						<br/><br />
						So why... why have gaming revenues remained flat for a decade? Visitor rates haven't been flat until relatively recently... there are millions more players at the slots and tables today than there were ten years ago. So why have revenues stayed flat?
						<br/><br />
						A five-word question deserves a five-word answer. Because LV is hemorrhaging high-rollers.
						<br/><br />	
						Its losing those players who can afford to hop in their G6 and gamble anywhere to places like Macau, which enjoyed a 20 percent increase in real dollar gaming revenue (to 3.5 billion USD) in December.

						</ul>
						The Eurasia development will stop that bleeding... it will stop it dead in its tracks... it will stop the bleeding and reverse it. It will bring the planet's biggest players back to Las Vegas as fast as their Gulfstreams, A318 Elite's and Citation's can carry them.
						<br/><br />	
						Why?
						<br/><br />	
						Because Eurasia will be a true Wonder of the World. And while there are numerous "wonderful" places to gamble - Macau being one - none of them are Wonders of the World.
						<br/><br />	
						None of them have 45 internationally themed resort casinos, none of them host Formula One, none of them have native entertainment, museums packed with treasures and culture centers from more than 100 countries, none of them have "under the sea" gladiator events, none of them have the world's most sophisticated convention facilities, none of them have millions of square feet of the most exclusive designer, boutique, jewelry and accessories shopping on earth, none of them have exclusive VIP Clubs where ultra rich and powerful patrons can commingle - sabsolutely free of distractions and intrusions from the press and public - with ultra beautiful and talented entertainers.
						<br/><br />	
						None of them even have full-sized archeologically and architecturally correct replicas of the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. But Eurasia will.
