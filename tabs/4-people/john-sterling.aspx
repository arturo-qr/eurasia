Within a year he was writing and recording songs with many famous artists including Gene McDaniel and Del Shannon.						<br /><br />						Passing on college scholarship offers after graduating from high school at age 17, John hit the road to work clubs all over the U.S. and Canada, eventually settling in Las Vegas where he joined Louis Prima, GiaMaione with Sam Butera and the Witnesses at the Sahara Hotel. While in Las Vegas, John also did arrangements and conducted the orchestras for some of the Strip's most successful production shows, including such Broadway adaptations as Hair.						<br /><br />						John also worked writing and conducting the orchestras for some of the most successful production shows on the Las Vegas strip including HAIR... but a change was coming his way.						<br /><br />						Joining Andy Williams' band Loadstone in Los Angeles, John won his first Gold Record for the Williams' album Get Together. Still in L.A., John hooked up with Eric Burdon, Jimmy Witherspoon and members of John's own band to produce the classic blue album Guilty for MGM.						<br /><br />						After Guilty's release, John toured with Eric and Jimmy a series of gigs that eventually led to the Eric Burton Stop album, on which John wrote and produced all the songs. Released on Capitol, this was the beginning of a string of 23 albums John produced with Burdon. Highlights include the soundtrack to the film "Comeback" and the music for Spielberg and Hank's classic "Joe vs. the Volcano."						<br /><br />						Another phase of John's career began when he met Robby Krieger of the Doors and introduced Krieger to Burdon, which resulted in a personal and working relationship in which Robby toured alongside Eric with John serving as the Musical Director of both. The fantastic results of this collaboration can be heard seen on their Ventura Beach DVD.						<br /><br />						John has also written the music to 16 films including Vanessa Williams' debut in "Under The Gun" for Magnum Pictures. Jazz has always been close to his heart and in 1991 he decided to produce the TV series "The Jazz Network" which ran for five years and featured the biggest names in jazz - giants like Chick Corea, John Scofield, McCoy Tyner, Tony Williams, and Freddie Hubbard -- all performing and giving in-depth interviews. In addition to being EURASIA's top audio executive, John continues to write and produce music for CDs, DVDs and television and is now adding "screenwriter" to his production credits with his new script "Payola." And he never stops rocking, just recently playing to a sold out show at the Roxy.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
