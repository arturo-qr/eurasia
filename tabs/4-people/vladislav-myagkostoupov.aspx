Arriving in the United States at the age of six, having already spent five years and four months touring with his parents, he studied with his father and is now considered one of the world's finest jugglers.						<br /><br />						Having visited Paris, Monte Carlo, Rome and London by the time he was two, Vladik began acrobatic training at the age of three. By the time he was six, his avid interest in juggling encouraged his father to begin training him in that field and he started his career in the United States at the age of eight, participating in small shows and conventions.						<br /><br />						At nine, he was invited to feature in "Passion" in Wendover, Nevada and went on to work "Magic 2010" at Trump's Castle in Atlantic City. In 1995, the same year he received a gold medal at the Juniors International Juggling competition, he opened at the Flamingo Hilton with the New York City Rocketts.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
