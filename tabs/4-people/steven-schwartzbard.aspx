Central Bank had been using IMF funds to artificially support price of the Russian currency, which was shorted by currency speculators. Initial suspension has led to severe erosion in investor confidence and negative chain reactions.						<br /><br />						The termination of supporting price of currency has been instrumental to Russia's bouncing back from the August 1998 financial crash with surprising speed and growth in domestic industries benefiting from the devaluation, which caused a steep increase in the prices of imported goods. Russia's economy had been helped by an infusion of cash generated by Russian enterprises, which were able to pay off debts in back wages and taxes.						<br /><br />						In addition to consumer demand for goods and services produced by the Russian industries has risen, the Russian government has managed to keep social and political pressures under control, and this has played a vital role in bringing about the current recovery.						<br /><br />						Today Russia is the only totally debt free country in the world.						<br /><br />						Schwartzbard has advised and assisted various companies located in the territories of the former USSR in the capacity of General Design and Marketing strategies, as well as designing the appropriate capital structure of these companies as well as business models in order to enter world capital markets by listing its financial instruments on the various stock exchanges around the world.						<br /><br />						Schwartzbard has also served in advisory capacity in the area of finance, capital reorganizations, debt reductions and restructurings and new business development matters to high ranking governmental officials such as Prime Minister of Dagestan Mr. Hizri Isaevitch Shiksaidov, Governors of Kazakhstan state Astana - Mr. Dauren Adelbekov, Russian Governors Mr. Aleksandr Rudskoy and Mr. Aleksandr Lebed, Ambasador of Afganistan to Russia, Mongolia, Iraq and Bulgaria - Mr. Azis Akbari, and Mr. Viacheslav Fetisov the Russian Minister of Sport.						<br /><br />						Mr. Schwartzbard holds an IMBA degree.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="/images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="/images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
