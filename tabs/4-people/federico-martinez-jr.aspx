At the age of 20 he started working as a programming director at the family owned Channel 17 KDI TV and later started a multimedia production company that provided production and programming to companies like Univision and Telemundo - eventually selling that company, the MediaLusion Group, to Univision and Telemundo affiliates in San Diego, California.						<br /><br />						In 2004 he became a major shareholder and operating partner in Planet X Television, a nationally syndicated TV show and a pioneer in action sports TV programming. Under his leadership, Planet X TV expanded to markets like Australia, Brazil and the lucrative U.S. Hispanic Market.						<br /><br />						In 2005 he was invited by the Ad Agency DDB in Guatemala to produce two commercials for their client Brahva Beer. Working with companies in Latin America on a project budgeted at more than $800,000 USD made him realize the potential and opportunity to establish an action sports and lifestyle Cable TV network for Latin America and the U.S. Hispanic Market, leading to the launch of Ole Entertainment SA de CV in Mexico in 2008.						<br /><br />						Partnering with SATMEX and Alterna TV, Ole established the Planet X Latin America Television Network which currently has distribution agreements with major cable companies in Mexico and Central and South America and is perfectly positioned to become the leader in action sports and youth Entertainment in Latin America.						<br /><br />						Mr. Martinez holds a Communications Degree from the Advanced technology Education Center and a telecommunications degree from Southwestern College.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
