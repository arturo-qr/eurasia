C. POST - Chief fundraising officer for Philanthropy, Charities &-Global Causes						</span>						<br /><br />						As director of the company's worldwide charitable fund raising efforts, Mr. Post is in charge of organizing fundraisers, directing corporate outreach strategies and developing its wide array of philanthropic initiatives.						<br /><br />						He is also responsible for Eurasia brand management, strategic acquisitions, corporate alliances, investor relations and, most importantly, accumulation of our portfolio of entertainment assets, and other intellectual property.						<br /><br />						Born and raised in Warsaw, Poland, Post had immigrated to the U.S., where he made his way in the Jewish banking world and achieved success. His financial success allowed him leisure time to pursue a life-long dream, being a patron to budding American and European artists. Post often told others that in his youth he had wanted to be a poet/playwright. His parents, however, refused to encourage-and sometimes openly condemned-his aspirations. Post claimed it was his parents' response to his dreams that made him resolve to become a patron to artists.						<br /><br />						Most artists in this era don't enjoy the financial support of the state, church, or individuals that artists had in previous ages. Those 20th-century artists who became famous did so through their own sweat and contractual relations with promoters and managers. Post is a throwback to the 15th-century patrons of the Italian Renaissance. His dream is when he dies to be compared to Lorenzo the Magnificent of the Medici family.						<br /><br />						A sample list of some of Post's philanthropic efforts in jazz patronage reflects the impact he had on the best jazz artists. He negotiated deals for many movies, music albums and TV programs.						<br /><br />						Mr. Post and the Founder of Global Family of Companies, Mr. John Sterling are friends for almost 40 years. Thanks to them Global has started to build its library of entertainment assets with intellectual property contributed jointly by Mr. Post and Mr. Sterling.						<br /><br />						Post is no Medici clone, however -his patronage is decidedly modern in approach. He insist on making loans, not grants, to artists. Mr. Post prefers loans because they could be deducted as losses from his personal assets under federal tax laws. However, Post is idiosyncratic and erratic regarding his beneficence. He entirely forgave some loans, while he requested full repayment of others- the loan to Frankie Avalon was written off as worthless, for example, while Post expected full repayment of Robby Krieger's loan. Post also differed from a classical patron in that he does not require his loans to be used solely for the production of art. Rather, Post sees his funds as a method of relieving an artist's "material cares for a while." He demands very little of the artists by way of accounting, other than periodic updates via visits or correspondence.						<br /><br />						In addition to providing cash, Post is a valuable patron in another way -he introduces his artists to the art world. Post's position with John Sterling of PBS's "Jazz Network" allowed him to introduce aspiring talent to directors, writers, and managers, thereby						pening the door and allowing the artist a chance to excel based on his own merits.						<br /><br />						In addition to funds and introductions, Post gives "moral" support to artists through his correspondence. He is careful not to become too familiar or intrusive in their lives, yet he responds with support when artists showing flagging spirits in their letters, or even when he might have justifiably felt used. When Chick Corea opted to accept an offer from a competing company, Post earnestly told him "I appreciate the loyalty and delicacy of your attitude toward me . . . We have neither the right nor desire to stand in the way." Post remained a patron to artists even during the early months following the crash of '2000. But, as the financial situation worsened, Post was unable to sustain his rate of philanthropy. Post's has been a victim of anti-Semitism at points in his life. He openly resigned from the board of a Polish Food Company because the other directors were uncomfortable with a Jew as board director.						<br /><br />						Although Post's name is not known to many, his contributions to artists is significant to those artists he produced.						<br /><br />						Post is in charge of Global Entertainment Assets, and its the company Fort Knox. A portfolio, for lack of a better term where we keep the corporate treasure. The "gold and diamonds" whose value remains unaffected by changes in currency rates, inflation, deflation or any other economic trauma. 						<br /><br />						Entertainment Assets, are the most gild-edged assets any Brick and Mortar or Information Age company can have.						<br /><br />						Assets which are better than cash because their value isn't decreased by inflation.
