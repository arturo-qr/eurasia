C. POST - Chief fundraising officer for Philanthropy, Charities &-Global Causes						</span>						<br /><br />						As director of the company's worldwide charitable fund raising efforts, Mr. Post is in charge of organizing fundraisers, directing corporate outreach strategies and developing its wide array of philanthropic initiatives.						<br /><br />						He is also responsible for Eurasia brand management, strategic acquisitions, corporate alliances, investor relations and, most importantly, accumulation of our portfolio of entertainment assets, and other intellectual property.						<br /><br />						Born and raised in Warsaw, Poland, Post had immigrated to the U.S., where he quickly found success in the banking world. This financial success empowered him to pursue a life-long dream, being a patron to budding American and European artists. Post frequently tells others that in his youth he had wanted to be a poet/playwright. His parents, however, refused to encourage-and sometimes openly condemned-his aspirations. He claims it was his parents' response to his dreams that made him resolve to become a patron to artists.						<br /><br />						Most artists in this era don't enjoy the financial support of the state, church, or individuals that artists had in previous ages. Those 20th-century artists who became famous did so through their own sweat and contractual relations with promoters and managers. Post is a throwback to the 15th-century patrons of the Italian Renaissance. His dream is when he dies to be compared to Lorenzo the Magnificent of the Medici family. Post is no Medici clone, however, his patronage is decidedly modern in approach, with an emphasis on loans rather than grants.						<br /><br />						Post also differs from classical patrons in that he does not require his loans to be used solely for the production of art. Rather, Post sees his funds as a method of relieving an artist's "material cares for a while." He demands very little of the artists by way of accounting, other than periodic updates via visits or correspondence.						<br /><br />						As the executive in charge of Global Entertainment Assets, Post directs our own version of Fort Knox, the vault in which we keep the corporate treasure - a portfolio of intellectual property -- copyrights, patents and trademarks whose value remains unaffected by changes in currency rates, inflation, deflation or any other economic trauma.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
