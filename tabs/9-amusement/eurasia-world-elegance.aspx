That's Project Runway. Project Runway, Hollywood's most popular, highly praised and most profitable view of the hyper-competitive, incredibly creative and intensely passionate world of high fashion. 						<br/><br />						Successful as it is, Project Runway is far from the only example of the world's obsession with the glamorous world of high fashion, seasonal street wear and hot clubbing outfits.						<br/><br />						To truly understand how pervasive the public's desire for fashion news, looks, and gossip requires a visit to bookstore or newsstand.						<br/><br />						Hundreds of general interest, news and recreational magazines that used the crowd the shelves of those businesses are now gone, out of business completely or relegated to cheesy online-only editions. But fashion magazines are proliferating.						<br/><br />						There are, in fact, more fashion magazines today than ever before with new ones launching every quarter. Thick, oversized fashion magazines, magazines that are very expensive to print and distribute. All of them full of ads, all of them selling well, all of them making money. And all of them international, published in many languages, subscribed to, sought after, and closely read by people in all but the very poorest nations of the earth. Eurasia's Fashion World will take visitors on an unprecedented tour behind the scenes of the world commonly known as everything from haute couture to the "rag trade." With teams of designers constantly creating new looks in Fashion World's design suites, visitors will get an insider's look at all stages of custom clothing creation -- from cutting patterns to selecting materials to construction, to embellishment, to final fittings on the exotic models who will wear the garments in our weekly televised runway competitions.						<br/><br />						<ul class="gallery1">							<li><img src="images2/p2_chapter_13.jpg" alt="Elegance" width="480px"></li>						</ul>						Runway competitions with a twist. Competitions in which members of the studio audience get the opportunity to serve on a panel of real-people judges who judge the professional judges.						<br/><br />						The premise is a simple as it is compelling. As on Project Runway, a panel of judges from the fashion industry and fashion magazines will select the winners and losers from among the designs produced on-site by teams of up-and-coming designers of the future.						<br/><br />						Once their judging is done however, the panel of judges selected from members of the audience gets to interrogate and judge the judges. To ask them to explain why they praised one dress and panned another. To force them to comment on why a gown which obviously couldn't be worn by anyone without being pinned and taped to make it fit was selected number one. To turn the tables on the experts and, in the process, create a great program for both the live audience in Las Vegas and the massive TV audience around the world.						<br/><br />						Needless to say, design competitions and television programs will only be two of the many attractions drawing people to Eurasia's fashion world. Other attractions will include workshops on creating designer clothes at home, rotating exhibits of next season's styles from the famous design houses of Europe and America, and historical displays of fashion accessory throughout history - from Cleopatra's time to ours.						<br/><br />						Last but not least, an interactive multimedia presentation will allow visitors to "meet", talk with, and be photographed next to eerily realistic electronic simulations of some of the most famous designers and fashion models in history.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
