Because the golf complex, as with everything else within Eurasia's boundaries, has to deliver more than a championship golfing experience. It has to appeal to international as well as national players and it has to represent not only the latest and greatest in design but also pay homage to the best of the traditional world.						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery2">							<li><img src="/images2/p2_chapter_10_1.jpg" alt="Golf World" width="280px"></li>						</ul>						Presenting the crown jewel in the box full of rare gems comprising Eurasia Golf World. St. Andrew's New Course. Fully licensed by and built with cooperation from the St. Andrew's Links Trust, St. Andrew's New Course, is a perfect mirror image of St. Andrew's Old Course, where the game of golf was first played more than 600 years ago.						<br /><br />						Universally known as the Home of Golf, St. Andrew's Old Course in Fife Scotland was, and still is, one of the most beautiful golf courses in the world. It is also one which many famous players from throughout the past six centuries, up to and including Tiger Woods, have publicly identified as their favorite course to play on.						<br /><br />						Eurasia's rendition of the Old Course will be truly authentic in every detail of distance, geometry and landscaping. Even the grass will be the same variety and length as that used in Fyfe and the sand for the sand traps will be imported from the same sources that supply sand for the Old Course and the Links Trust's six other historically significant gold courses.						<br /><br />						The second of Eurasia's Golf World courses will be a PGA-championship caliber masterpiece designed by Jack Nicklaus, who since his days as the PGA's Tour's leading champion has become synonymous with the development of exclusive golf courses for the world's leading luxury golf communities.						<br /><br />						With seven of Travel and Leisure's Golf top ten golf community courses and four Wall Street Journal Golf Courses of Distinction courses to his credit, Nicklaus-designed courses are far and away the favorite places for business and recreational golfers - even the duffers among them -- who appreciate the look and feel of playing under tournament conditions.						<br /><br />						And than there's the third golf course, the culmination of Bill Coore's three decades of designing visionary golf courses that fit seamlessly into the landforms their site provides. A creative miracle that Coore performs by modeling the fairways and greens to fit natureâ€™s shapes and contours instead of bringing in phalanxes of bulldozers to muscle and mangle what nature has wrought into a golfer's pre-fabbed image.						<br /><br />						<ul class="gallery">							<li><img src="/images2/p2_chapter_10_2.jpg" alt="Golf World" width="280px"></li>						</ul>						"Even if most golfers will eventually be taking carts," Coors says, "the route the course takes through the land should seem natural, aligned with how they would instinctively traverse the land if they were on foot."						<br /><br />						When it comes to golf course design, that path - the natural and instinctive one - is definitely the route less traveled. For many Eurasia golfers, however, it may just turn out to be the one most beloved.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="/images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="/images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="/images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
