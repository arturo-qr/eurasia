To fully satisfy and exceed the expectations of the vast number of Formula One Grand Prix followers who will be visiting Formula One World at Eurasia we will be offering a unique one-of-a-kind Grand Prix experience in which guests seated in genuine Formula One race cars "stretched" to accommodate two passengers are driven around Eurasia's Formula One track at racing speeds by retired Grand Prix drivers. Other major Formula One World attractions include simulated pit stops in which teams of visitors compete against each other and the clock to win free tickets to one of our two annual Formula One Races, historic displays and 3D presentations, and the chance to wine and dine in a true Formula One hospitality tent sponsored by a major Formula One racing team.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
