That's probably still true, but in my recent travels I discovered so many people have connections, friends or experience in Las Vegas that our city at least qualifies for the title of "cross-trail of the world.""						</p>						...Hank Greenspun, founder, editor and publisher of the Las Vegas Sun. He warred against Hitler in the trenches with Patton, battled for Israel when enemies tried to strangle it at birth, and always... always fought for his beloved Las Vegas, fought for the sun-blasted village that he more than anyone else helped transform in to a true wonder of the modern world.						<br/><br />						RIP, Hank, neither this town nor anywhere else will see your like again.						<br/><br />						Many, many things about Las Vegas are right - perfect even - just the way they are. It's still the live entertainment capital of the world. It's the convention capital of the United States, it draws more than 40 million visitors a year, is home to a great and growing university and has managed, over the past two decades, to use its tax structure and geographical advantages to attract a robust noncasino/ resort-related base composed primarily of non-polluting, "green" light manufacturing, warehousing and technology companies.						<br/><br />						There are many other good things we could mention about Las Vegas. The Vegas of right here, right now. But we're going to skip calling them out because a.) You already know what they are and b.) What's "right" has little to do with Eurasia.						<br/><br />						<ul class="gallery">							<li><img src="images2/Intro_Restablishing.jpg" alt="Restablishing Las Vegas" height="350" width="281"></li>						</ul>												Our project, the Eurasia project, is not about re-inventing any wheels or trying to fix this, that or some other thing that isn't broken. No. The Eurasia model is very different. It's based upon finding what is broken and deploying visionary business models, creative financing solutions and advanced technology to fix them.						<br/><br />						To put it another way, we search out high-growth business opportunities other developers may have missed and reanimate those parts of the enterprise that have quit working altogether or are performing at less than optimal levels.						<br/><br />						Sadly, there are number of critical areas in which, to steal a clich√© from the Japanese, Las Vegas, Inc., is performing far from optimally. Key areas in its economy where it has, in fact, slipped badly, a slippage which began, in many cases, years before the 2008 financial meltdown.						<br/><br />						In this web site you'll find some of the issues facing Las Vegas as it heads farther into the 21st Century world of global resort competition and a never-ending explosion of non-traditional entertainment options. And you'll see our projected solutions for these issues.						<br/><br />						In this web site we'll reveal our casino/resort convention, sports, theme park, golfing wonders of the world and other attractions discuss our plans and their financial implications and opportunities in more detail. Also we'll talk about our company, our unprecedented billion-dollar TV, Internet and live marketing blitz and some of our key people.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
