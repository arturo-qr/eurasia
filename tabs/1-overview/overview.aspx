The Palace of Little Angels is a children's after school and weekend learning and event center. We plan on creating a new education standard by providing an enriched cultural environment using the resources available throughout the complex. Children will have access to advanced level extracurricular programs in fine and performing arts, instruction in music lessons and history - with an emphasis on learning to play an instrument, ballet, drama, literature and science. Athletic programs include gymnastics, golf, tennis, equestrian skills, archery as well as "finishing school".

All buildings and attractions will be developed and implemented as Green Buildings. Considerations for the environment and water conservation will be at the utmost importance, as we aim to be leaders in the environmental causes as well.						<br /><br />						The EURASIA project will change the face of Las Vegas. Las Vegas has always been on the cutting edge - creating newer, more exciting destinations for visitors to see. Designed by Tilke Engineering and crafted by J.T. Kruer and Company, EURASIA will take Las Vegas to the next level. Visitor volume to Las Vegas has been stagnant for the last 7 years - tourists need to have something new to see to move the needle. EURASIA is the future, and will not only produce an enormous increase in taxable revenues to the state, but also will bring more international visitors because of our exposure in those markets. Only 16% of Las Vegas visitors come from foreign counties. Our clientele, or expertise, our design is geared to market to international visitors. The EURASIA project IS the future and is destined to change how the world thinks about Las Vegas.					</div>				</div>			</div>			<div id="TwitterFeedHeader"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer" style="width: 380px;  padding: 0px 0px 10px 70px; height: 87px; ">			<!-- <a title="Live the M life" rel="lightbox[southchapel]" href="/peelad/interior_popup.swf?width=252&amp;height=525"><img src="images/home/Mlife-Banner.jpg" width="300" height="87" border="0" style="margin: 0px; float: left;"/></a> -->			</div>			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<!-- Twitter Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"><img src="images/btn-Twitter-on.jpg">				<span id="lblDisplayTweet_LblTweet"> 					<p>#FF #GlobalLtd @MarginInvestors @PennyStock @AcesOfACTS </p>				</span>			</div>			<!-- /Twitter Feed -->				<div class="HomePageRule"><img src="images/spacer_002.gif" height="1" width="470"></div>			<!-- Facebook Feed -->			<div id="TwitterFeedContainer"></div>			<!-- /Facebook Feed -->			<div class="HomePageRule"></div>			<div id="TwitterFeedViewAllNews" style="float: right;"></div>		</div><!-- /Twitter Feed -->		</div></div></asp:Content>
